# Thunkunt's Arena Send-Off
Multiple Rounds, at least 2.  What Thunkunt doesn't know is that Tsuto has used what's left of his family's cash and influence to hire more dangerous opposition for Thunkunt.  He hopes that they'll kill Thunkunt so he can have his revenge.
## Round 1: The Gutripper Gang
A mob of unruly goblins who fight in the arena.  I'm thinking 6 goblins
* 5 Goblins
* 1 Wild Card Commando (The eponymous 'Gutripper')
None of them will want to be the first to rush in, instead they'll use their shortbows to try and keep him at bay, possibly climbing the arena props to avoid him.  Once he closes, they'll focus on trying to gang up to make openings for Gutripper (Support & Tests to grab Thunkunt and trip him, distract him with small cuts or bites).

If Thunkunt is just demolishing them, they may cheat and slip a debilitating poison into one of their attacks if they can.

## Intermission
During the Intermission the Arena Master will offer Thunkunt a **Potion of Healing** if needed to remove 1 wound.
## Round 2: The Black Beast of Sothis
The Black Beast of Sothis is a Minotaur (WC?) with **Bruiser**, **Brute**, and an upgraded **Athletics (d8)**.  His preferred weapons are the heavy chains attached to the broken shackles on his wrists (counts as unarmed d12+d6+1).

## Intermission
Assess Thunkunt's condition, offer healing as needed.  Maybe get Bacun involved here.  If Thunkunt is winning easily, the Arena Master is replaced by someone else offering him the potion.  It's actually a mild poison to weaken him before the final round.

## Round 3: ???
See how the first two rounds go.

## Including Bacun
Bacun isn't a fighter, she may be able to help Thunkunt between fights somehow, but I'd like to clue her in to the fact that the fights are being rigged against him.  She can do a little investigating behind the scenes while Thunkunt fights for his life.
