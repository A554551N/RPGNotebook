| Silvertree Leaf |  4  |                         allows you to reroll the result of post-game Injuries. If the character would originally have died, increase recovery time by +D3 campaign turns.  They have no effect on rolls on the Flight in the Dark Tables                         |
|     Torches     |  3  | During battle, a warband member who is not using a shield or a Bulky weapon may carry a torch. This creates visibility within 6", allowing shots to be taken at illuminated figures despite visibility limitations (from darkness, fog, or during site battles). |
| Essence Crystal |  1  | The crystal may be used as a *Use* Action, and allows a known spell to be cast without using a Strand and without requiring a *Casting* roll                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
