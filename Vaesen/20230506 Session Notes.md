- Sven & Astrid continue investigating.  Sven follows Sami into the old Conservatory while Astrid discusses the missing mother with Sophia.
- Sami goes into the Conservatory to pray and beg Nora to stop cursing them
	- Sven follows him and overhears the conversation, then confronts him.  He convinced Sami to turn over the keys to Nora's rooms.
- Astrid gets Sophia talking about her relationship with her mother, learns that Nora invited actors to the inn, which sparked her departure.
- They search Nora's room and discover her journal, which describes her mistreatment at Sami's hand and her weird nightmares about Oscar.
- They decide to search Sami's room, but find it locked.  Sven tries to block Sami from going up the stairs, but finds him to be in a trance.  He claims not to have a wife and doesn't recognize Sven.  Instead, he seems to believe that he is his grandfather Pyri.
	- When Sven prevents him from going to his room, he turns and instead goes to the storage room where he attempts to hang himself.
	- Sven tries to stop him, but his prosthetic foot goes through the floor and he gets stuck.
	- Astrid tries to talk him down by reminding him of his duty to his daughter.  This doesn't work because he doesn't believe he has a daughter.
	- After he hangs, an invisible claw carves the words "Pyri the Traitor" into the wall behind him.
- Sven and Astrid go to find Sophia, and get roped into watching her play "The Dance of Dreams"
	- The play details the life of Oscar Hjort, from birth until his death at the hands of his lover Albert and his Society colleagues.
	- At the end of the show, Sophia falls unconscious and Hjort's spirit appears in the theatre.  He appears to blame the current Society for his death.
- Seeing the revenant, the group elects to wake up the priest (by burning him with hot metal to break the spell) and they head out into the cellar to consecrate Oscar's grave.
	- They do this while the Sleepwalkers (everyone else in the inn) attempt to break down the cellar door and stop him.  Once the ritual is complete, the walkers wake up and don't clearly remember what happened.
- The priest helps sell a cover story that there was some kind of gas leak(?) that made everyone sleepy.
- Astrid and Sven reveal to Sophia that her father is dead.  This trauma awakens her family's latent talent for the Sight in her.
