# Summary
Count Bendz of Vildbjerg has a secret, he can see monsters.  From a young age, he was called a fool and a liar, but that didn't stop him from seeing them.  As he got older he realized he could talk to them too.
Now a man grown, he rules his lands with a hard hand just like his father taught him.  After the serfs revolted against him, he spoke to one of the monsters.  He offered it gold if it would help him to keep his throne.

So far the arrangement has gone swimmingly, while the rebels might still desire to oust him, they cannot do so without earning the ire of the worm.  It uses its magic to push people away from a destructive course, but Bendz has convinced her that killing one of the ringleaders will solve the problem permanently.

# Countdown
1. A judge arrives from (Nearby City)

# Countdown
# The Lindworm, Glitterpool
**Might** 12 | **Body Control** 8 | **Magic** 8 | **Manipulation** 7 | **Fear** 2
*The Lindworm is an ancient reptilian creature with razor sharp claws and a white mane.  It prefers to dwell beneath ruins, churches, and oak trees.  Like other dragons, they hoard treasure in their lairs.  They enjoy tricking humans and putting them under their spell.*

*Glitterpool specifically has lived near a pond outside of town for hundreds of years.  The villagers used to bring her shiny things to add to her hoard at the bottom of the pond.  In the last generation or so though, no one brings her gifts.  This lack of respect made her susceptible to Count Bendz proposition.  If she uses her magic and claws to keep the villagers in mind, he would make sure she got all the rewards she deserved.*

*When the villagers would make offerings, she would frequently roll into town after the villagers were asleep and use her magic to heal their sick.  She saw it as them taking care of each other, it makes her even angrier that they have forgotten her.*

## Weakness
A Lindworm can be killed by tricking it into slithering through three different fires, though the first two will have no effect, the third will end it.

Slitherpool just wants to be remembered again, she would be willing to stop aiding Count Bendz if only the village would begin making offerings to her once more.  Unfortunately, Count Bendz' lavish gifts have skewed her idea of acceptable sacrifice.

## Magic
- Enchant (Enthrall, Animal Control, Spread Disease)
- Curse (Night Terrors, Infect, Fear)
- Armor (Protection 6)
- Takes no damage from fire
- Moves quickly by rolling
- Heals two Conditions if left alone for two turns.

## Conditions
- [ ] Alert +1
- [ ] Spiteful
- [ ] Mad +1
- [ ] Dazed -2 (Withdraws to Heal)
- [ ] Panicking +1 (spits corrosive venom at everyone in range, slow action)
- [ ] Cautious -1
- [ ] Wounded -2 (bargains for its life)
- [ ] Broken - Hurls itself headlong into its enemies and then flees, returns after 1d6 hours.

# NPCs
## Johann Kurtz
Johann is an old soldier and a former friend of Sven's.  He has been suffering under the rule of Count Bendz with the rest of the village, but his soldier spirit has led to him building up a resistance against the Count.  Along with a few other ringleaders he has been collecting medicine, food, and weapons to use in the upcoming battle.

Unfortunately he was a bit too outspoken for the Count's liking, and he was killed by a villager acting as the Lindworm's puppet.

## Oleana Lindgren
Oleana is a baker and another member of the rebellion against Bendz.  She was smarter about keeping her allegiances quiet, but not quiet enough.  The Lindworm used her as a weapon to kill Johann (at Bendz' insistance).  She was immediately caught and is now being held in the village's meagre jail until the Count is ready to see her.

A search of her house will reveal a cache of preserved food and medicine under the floorboards.

## Isac Lindgren
Tobjorn is a stubborn older man who works at the carriage post.  He is married to Oleana, and is aware that she's involved in something with folks in town.  He is suspicious that she is having an affair, which is seemingly confirmed by the murder.

## Torsten Bremen
Isac is the town's blacksmith.  Up until recently he has been working against the Count in secret, mending armor and manufacturing weapons.  Broad and tall, with a dark beard and a pronounced limp.  He is known to talk as little as possible.

This makes it all the more surprising when he comes out in support of the Count.  He has spent his evenings bellowing to anyone who will listen at the tavern that the problems of the village are the fault of witches and monsters, not the Count.

## Miriam Sparv
Miriam Sparv is the mistress of the Arjeplog school.  She is friendly and outgoing, but worried about the change that's come over Torsten (whom she fancies) and the death of her friend Johann.  She knows that Oleana and Johann weren't romantic, but can't explain their connection without endangering herself.

Miriam has a small but functional library of folklore collected from the older folks around town that she is collecting 'For Posterity'

## Count Bendz
Count Bendz is lord of Arjeplog County.  He's a hard man, but he disguises it under a thin veneer of sociability.  His father has left the county in debt, and he is pushing the serfs and villagers hard to find more money to pay his creditors.  The people refuse to be pushed further, and a revolution is brewing in the village.

He is superstitious, and becoming paranoid about visitors to the village (believing that they might be associates of the rebellion)

# Hook
*A letter received by Sven several weeks after the events at the Black Cat Inn*

Greetings brother,
It's been so long since our days on the battlefield together, and to be honest I thought you dead.  Imagine my surprise when I heard from another fellow that they'd seen you alive and well in Upsala.

Though catching up would be reason enough to seek you out, I must admit I have an ulterior motive in my letter.  It's somewhat delicate and I'd prefer to discuss it in person at my home in Arjeplog (we're about three days north of Upsala by train and carriage) if you're willing.  The situation is queer and I'm not sure I could put it into writing even if I were sure this letter wouldn't be intercepted.

If you're willing, I will expect you in Arjeplog in no more than two weeks.  I can't wait to see you again.

Your Friend,
Johann
