- Session 1 - The Dance of Dreams
	- This is the gang's first adventure.  They meet Algot Frisk, the butler.
	- To access the dungeons, you must pull the book "The Imprisonment of the Soul" (3rd bookcase, 3rd shelf, 3rd book from the left)
	- The gang removed some journals from the old dissection room in the dungeon.
	- The gang does Research
		- They learn about the Witch Cat's connections to the old [[Society]], and that the owner's grandfather (the original owner) was Sighted.
		- The main character of the play is a real person, who was also a member of the Upsala [[Society]].  According to their records, he is dead.
	- They head to the Witch Cat in a howling rainstorm
	-  They meet the contact who sent them the letter (PI Klint) who tells them about the weird dreams that guests of the inn have been experiencing.  He believes there is a powerful entity at work within the Inn and wants their help to deal with it.
	- Inside the Inn, the place is obviously in disrepair (and it seems like all of the damage is relatively recent.)
	- There are three guests in the Inn, a Farmer, a Chemist (High on Opium), and a former Soldier-turn-Priest who recognizes [[Sven]] from their mutual soldiering days.
		- Sven was a member of the ill-fated 332nd Fusiliers, who were killed to a man near the village of Talknaras during an otherwise unnoteworthy land dispute.
	- After a brief interrogation, the Chemist retreats to her room and the Priest prepares to leave. 
	- After a few minutes, the Priest comes back saying that he'd forgotten something.  As he does, the fire burns blue and all the gaslamps go out.  Everyone in the room save for the Heroes, the innkeep, and his daughter, immediately pass out and cannot be roused.
	- As the curtain closes on the session, the innkeep breaks, praying to God to take this perdition away.  "Please God, let her rest, let her not curse me like this!"
