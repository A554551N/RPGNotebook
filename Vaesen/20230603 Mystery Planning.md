# Summary
Count Bendz of Vildbjerg has a secret, he can see monsters.  From a young age, he was called a fool and a liar, but that didn't stop him from seeing them.  As he got older he realized he could talk to them too.
Now a man grown, he rules his lands with a hard hand just like his father taught him.  After the serfs revolted against him, he spoke to one of the monsters.  He offered it gold if it would help him to keep his throne.

So far the arrangement has gone swimmingly, while the rebels might still desire to oust him, they cannot do so without earning the ire of the worm.  It uses its magic to push people away from a destructive course, but Bendz has convinced her that killing one of the ringleaders will solve the problem permanently.

# The Lindworm, Glitterpool
**Might** 12 | **Body Control** 8 | **Magic** 8 | **Manipulation** 7 | **Fear** 2
*The Lindworm is an ancient reptilian creature with razor sharp claws and a white mane.  It prefers to dwell beneath ruins, churches, and oak trees.  Like other dragons, they hoard treasure in their lairs.  They enjoy tricking humans and putting them under their spell.*

*Glitterpool specifically has lived near a pond outside of town for hundreds of years.  The villagers used to bring her shiny things to add to her hoard at the bottom of the pond.  In the last generation or so though, no one brings her gifts.  This lack of respect made her susceptible to Count Bendz proposition.  If she uses her magic and claws to keep the villagers in mind, he would make sure she got all the rewards she deserved.*

*When the villagers would make offerings, she would frequently roll into town after the villagers were asleep and use her magic to heal their sick.  She saw it as them taking care of each other, it makes her even angrier that they have forgotten her.*

## Weakness
A Lindworm can be killed by tricking it into slithering through three different fires, though the first two will have no effect, the third will end it.

Slitherpool just wants to be remembered again, she would be willing to stop aiding Count Bendz if only the village would begin making offerings to her once more.  Unfortunately, Count Bendz' lavish gifts have skewed her idea of acceptable sacrifice.
