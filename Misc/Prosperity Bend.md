# Prosperity Bend
A Town for *Dogs in the Vineyard*
## Pride
- Sister Ella doesn't love her husband.  She thinks she could do better than him, and she's probably right.
	- When the outlaws came to town and started camping near the river, Ella fell head over heels for Jasper, the boss of the band.  Because of this, she's been ignoring her husband, Brother August, and her children, so that she can sneak away to see Jasper.
	- Sister Constance, Ella's friend, has become a surrogate mother to the boys (Eli and Eleazer), this cuts into the time she can spend on her own family.
- Brother Tobias believes he deserves to be named Steward after years of service to the Branch.
	- Brother Tobias uses his success to put pressure on Brother Ham (the Steward) by trading goods for favor.  Additionally, he's hired some outlaws (led by Jasper) to scare the folks with raids and make them believe old Steward Ham hasn't got what it takes to lead.
- Brother August believes his woman's place is beside him in the field, in addition to raising the children
	- Brother August puts a lot of pressure on his wife, Sister Ella, to handle women's duties and also help him in the field.  He says he won't need her help as much once the boys are older.
## Sin
- Sister Ella is lying to her husband and friend, she's also having sex with Jaspar the Outlaw
- Brother Tobias is damaging the community for his own gain (Disunity)
- Sister Constance followed Ella when she snuck out of town and saw her with Jasper.  She is quietly furious at the way her friend is taking advantage of her in order to engage in sinful liaisons.  However, Constance doesn't have many friends in town, and is afraid of what will happen if she outs Sister Ella.
## Demonic Attacks
- In spite of a truly tremendous amount of work, Brother August's farm isn't yielding the way it used to.  As a result, he needs Sister Ella around more to help out "until the young'uns is growed".  This causes resentment in Ella, who only wants to go see Jasper.
- Brother Tobias' farm, on the other hand, is doing quite well say thankee.  This flourishing helps sooth his conscience that hiring the outlaws was wrong.
- Sister Constance's husband Brother Ham has fallen rather ill, leaving her with more to do to care for the family.  This fuels her resentment of Ella.  As Brother Ham is Steward, it also leaves room for Tobias to do more of his jobs.  Constance appreciates Tobias stepping in so that she can manage her duties and Ella's.
## False Doctrine

## The Dogs
### What do They Want From the Dogs?

- Brother August wants the Dogs to force Sister Ella to stay home and help him in the fields
- Brother Ham wants the Dogs to make him well
- Brother Tobias wants the Dogs to make him Steward
- Sister Constance wants the Dogs to uncover Ella's deception, but doesn't want them to get it from her.
### What do the Demons want?
- For Sister Ella to be taken away by Jasper during the raid, so that August and Tobias will rally the townspeople against them.  This leads to bloodshed

- To bring followers to Tobias and instantiate a False Priesthood
### If the Dogs never came...
- Jasper and his gang conduct a more brazen raid on the town in order to steal from and frighten the villagers.  Additionally, Jasper hopes to carry off his lover Ella.
- During the raid, Brother August is killed trying to keep the outlaws from kidnapping his wife.
- Jasper is killed by Brother Tobias, to ensure that no one knows of his hand in these crimes.  He's hailed as a hero, and when Brother Ham dies of his illness, Tobias takes the Stewardship.
- Ella is devastated by the death of Jasper and retreats into herself, leaving Constance once more the mother of Ella's boys.
- Constance, unable to take it anymore and dealing with the loss of her own husband, kills Sister Ella with a frying pan.
