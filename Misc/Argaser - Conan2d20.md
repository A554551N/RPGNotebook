# Story
Whatever offense was committed, you didn’t do it.  Somehow you were blamed, and another bore witness against you, falsely. You tried to explain this when you were accused, but the high priest did not care. Your penance was brief, but unduly harsh. What were you accused of?  What was the penance? Do you know who incriminated you? Do you plot revenge?

# Talents
## Hunter
You’ve lived with the wild as a constant neighbor, and know how to take from that environment what is necessary for survival. When in the rural parts of your homeland, the Difficulty for any Survival tests you attempt is reduced by 1, even if this reduces the Difficulty of the test to Simple (D0).

## Priest
You are an ordained priest in one of the land’s many cults.  Wherever in a town or city your faith has a presence, you may spend time amidst the faithful before traveling again. 
When Carousing, if you do not have sufficient Gold to pay your Upkeep, you may turn to your order for support. If you do so, you are required to donate all remaining Gold you have. If you attempt to cheat your order out of any of the Gold they are owed, you are expelled from the order and lose access to this talent until restitution or some sort of penance has been made (at the gamemaster’s discretion).

## Subject
You are a subject in good standing to a lord or king. While subject to their laws, the taxes you face are much less than the more expensive taxes others experience. Whenever you pay Upkeep within your homeland, you can reduce the amount of Gold the Upkeep costs by one.
