# Story
**Age** 20
Whatever offense was committed, you didn’t do it.  Somehow you were blamed, and another bore witness against you, falsely. You tried to explain this when you were accused, but the high priest did not care. Your penance was brief, but unduly harsh. What were you accused of?  What was the penance? Do you know who incriminated you? Do you plot revenge?

Gained the Favor of a local noble

# Talents
## Hunter
You’ve lived with the wild as a constant neighbor, and know how to take from that environment what is necessary for survival. When in the rural parts of your homeland, the Difficulty for any Survival tests you attempt is reduced by 1, even if this reduces the Difficulty of the test to Simple (D0).

## Priest
You are an ordained priest in one of the land’s many cults.  Wherever in a town or city your faith has a presence, you may spend time amidst the faithful before traveling again. 
When Carousing, if you do not have sufficient Gold to pay your Upkeep, you may turn to your order for support. If you do so, you are required to donate all remaining Gold you have. If you attempt to cheat your order out of any of the Gold they are owed, you are expelled from the order and lose access to this talent until restitution or some sort of penance has been made (at the gamemaster’s discretion).

## Subject
You are a subject in good standing to a lord or king. While subject to their laws, the taxes you face are much less than the more expensive taxes others experience. Whenever you pay Upkeep within your homeland, you can reduce the amount of Gold the Upkeep costs by one.

## Strong Back 1
You are a magnificent example of human physical prowess, all-too-frequently abused for this ability. For any Athletics test that generates at least one success, you generate one additional success for each rank of Strong Back. Further, your Encumbrance limit is increased by 1 for each rank of Strong Back.

## Quiet Wisdom
You may re-roll any dice that did not generate a success on the initial roll when making a Counsel test, but you must accept the new result.

## Born in the Saddle 1
You have spent a lifetime in the company of animals and can recognize personality quirks and identify potential sources of distress. On any Animal Handling test where you generate at least one success, you may immediately roll a number of bonus d20s equal to your ranks of Born 
in the Saddle, up to the normal maximum of three bonus d20s. Any successes generated on these additional dice are added to the initial success total, and Complications on these additional dice may be ignored. 

## Scribe
You have had access to at least a small library of books, scrolls, or tablets, and gained a fascination with learning and knowledge. When rolling a Lore test you gain one bonus Momentum for every d20 that rolls less than your Lore Focus. This bonus Momentum can only be used for 
the **Obtain Information** Momentum spend.
