# Questions to Ask
- Nail Down a Concept First

# Things to Include
- A Chase
- A gunfight
- A Duel
- High Weirdness

# Sample Outline
- The scene opens on a chase across `an appropriate environment`.  PC is chasing after a gang of criminals who have wronged him in some way.
	- Make up some appropriate obstacles
	- Foes are Gunmen fleeing for the safety of their camp.
	- If they succeed in escaping, they'll rouse the camp and the hero will have to fight his way through an ambush.
	- If the hero succeeds, the camp won't be expecting him and he can catch the boss off guard
- A gunfight ensues, whether at the campsite or in the plains before they can arrive.
- One way or another, the hero arrives at the campsite and meets his `nemesis`
- They showdown
	- If the hero happens to get shot here, I need a plan to avoid a game-over.  Maybe they leave him for dead and *he* gets Harrowed.
- Putting the camp behind him, the hero heads for civilization (pick a town name and set it up a little) to collect the bounty on his nemesis.
	- After a brief wind-down scene (if the Hero has wounds we'll give him a week to Natural Heal), a scout comes blindly panic running into town.  He says there's...

## Option 1: Zombie Gang
A gang of Walkin' Dead led by a man on a black horse.  The scout barely escaped from them with his life and they're definitely coming this way.

A big ol' handful of Walkin' Dead extras with the newly reanimated `nemesis` at the head.

## Option 2: The 'Glom
An indescribable monstrosity coming this way.  He ain't never seen a buncha folks get mashed together like that, but it's hungry and not far behind.

A Wild Card 'Glom with a Wild Card Reckoner Cultist (who endeavors to stay out of the way) and a couple Extra cultists.  He got run out of town for delving secrets men weren't meant to know, and now he's back for vengeance.  The instrument of his vengeance being (of course) all the dead bodies our hero just left behind.
