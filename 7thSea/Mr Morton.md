"Mr. Morton" is a [[Sidhe]] Avalonian spy who posed as a spice merchant when he visited the [[Isle of Bernoulli]] in search of the fugitive [[Rafe Gage]].

He met [[Saoirse]] at the home of [[Giovanni Bernoulli]] and attempted to recruit her to the cause of assassinating [[Rafe Gage|Baron Gage]].  She didn't aid him, but also didn't help [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]] escape.

When we last saw him he was squaring off with the fugitive Baron in his office on the [[Isle of Bernoulli]].
