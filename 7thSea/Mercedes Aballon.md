**Affiliation:** Brotherhood of the Coast, [[La Bucca]]

Mercedes was a member of [[Saoirse]]'s crew aboard the [[Vengeance]] who attempted (with the aid of her brother [[Alejandro Abellan|Alejandro]], the Warden of [[La Bucca]]) to convince the crew of the [[Vengeance]] to oust [[Saoirse]] as captain when it became clear that her focus was on finding her husband rather than on finding money to pay the crew.

While her revolution on the [[Vengeance]] ultimately failed, she did end up finding a new ship to helm in time to attempt to capture [[Saoirse]] in the **Highland Strait** outside of [[Avalon]] while the latter was transporting refugee priests from **Castille** who were wanted by the **Vaticine Inquisition**.  The fight didn't go her way, and [[Saoirse]] embarrassed Mercedes while escaping her clutches.
