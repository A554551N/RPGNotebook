# Summary
The Baronet Sumner is a cunning and charming man that paid his way into the nobility through his shipping business.  His newly won crown sits quite naturally on his head, and he is well liked by the peerage even if they can't fully ignore the matter of his low birth.

Despite his title and recently being elevated to the title of **Chief Provisioner** for the Sea Dogs (he's responsible for getting ships outfitted and men paid), the Baronet plots in secret against the Monarach.  His shipping business carries messages and arms for rebels against Elaine's crown, while his connections to Vesten raiders in the North strangle other shipping companies that would cut into his business.  Why does he do this?  Does he believe in the cause of these rebels?  Not particularly, moreso he sees promotion for himself in their efforts.  If they are successful in their bid, they will give him a place of authority among them, and if it seems like they will lose he will simply turn them over to the authorities and receive his accolades that way.

# How Does He Challenge Saoirse?
Saoirse is both a Monarchist and an Avalonian patriot.  The baronet is her opposite number in many ways.  Where she fights for loyalty he fights for money, where she fights her own battles he hires out his dirty work.  Where she has ideals he has only cruel pragmatism.

Additionally, the Baronet is an Influence based villain.  At least at the outset she can't really solve him with a sword as she might prefer.  She'll have to do some intriguing to isolate the Baronet from his powerful friends so that she can strike him down.

# Schemes
## Put an end to Allerton Limited - 2 Pts
- Allerton Limited is a rival shipping company that specializes in moving high-value goods through dangerous waters
- Sumner knows that Allerton has recently been contracted to move valuable royal goods from Carleon to **Kirkwall** in the Marches.
- He has hired [[GM Story - Enemy of the Crown|Halla the Red]] to take the ship and its cargo.  The loss of the goods will compromise Allerton and convince the Queen to send her shipping via a safer alternative.

# Arcana
## Virtue - The Moonless Night (Subtle)
Activate your Virtue when you act behind the scenes, from the shadows or via proxy.  For the next Risk, when you determine Raises, every die rolled counts as a Raise.

## Hubris - The Magician (Ambitious)
The ambitious villain is rewarded when they chase after power and the deal causes them trouble.

# Advantages
## Lyceum
You studied rhetoric and debate at one of Theah's great Lyceums.  When you make a Risk to Convince, Intimidate, or Tempt, all of your dice gain +1 to their value

## Disarming Smile
Spend a **Danger Point** to keep another character from drawing a weapon, starting a fight, or resorting to violence.  They will still defend themselves, but won't start any violent conflicts.

## An Honest Misunderstanding
Spend a **Danger Point** to *reinterpret* something you just said in a way that everyone around believes that you are paying the subject of your threat or insult a compliment.
