#sessionNotes 
**Location:** [[Avalon]], **The Northern Trade Sea**

- [[Saoirse]] tries to convince [[Captain Dennis Moss]] to use his ship to pursue Sumner's Hired Pirates ([[GM Story - Enemy of the Crown]]), but realizes she's not even sure if she's getting paid yet (and so can't offer that payment to Dennis.)
- She tries to contact Morton but can't reach him, so she goes looking for the ship that is bound to carry the Vesten men back to the pirates
	- She finds which dock to go to by Tempting the night watchman
	- The Vesten men are bound to depart aboard Sumner's ship *The Radiant Bounty*
	- Sumner's company is called **The Progress Company**
	- She decides on the spur of the moment to attempt to sabotage the ship so that it can't leave on schedule so that Dennis will have time to get his crew together to give chase.
	- She learns that Halla's crew aren't all on board with her alliance with Sumner, and that the Captain of the *Bounty* knows of a rednezvous with Halla's ship.
	- She is spotted by **Gundred Thorsson** and he and his crew give chase through the harbor.  She escapes them with some wounds
	- She successfully sabotaged the *Bounty*, it won't make it out of the harbor before the storm arrives, which gives Dennis' crew an advantage.
- She meets with [[Mr Morton]] after the affair at the docks.  He says he will help Saoirse to create a fake office, and offers to secure a ship for her to use.
	- He steals the navy ship *Diligent* and gives Saoirse 2 days to return it.
- While the rest of the crew is off fighting Halla, Saoirse goes on her date with [[Baronet Bartram Sumner]]
	- Saoirse focuses on learning more about Sumner
	- He spends his Raises looking for flaws in her character that he can exploit later.
	- They agree to another date in two days time, a picnic.
	- Sumner tells his backstory, including how the proprietor of the shipping company he worked for 'mysteriously and tragically died,' leaving him the company.
	- Gundred Thorsson has a cousin who works as a middle-manager in the Vendel League (it's Gunnleaf, who Saoirse sold a ship to)
	-
