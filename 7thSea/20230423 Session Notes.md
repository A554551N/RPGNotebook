#sessionNotes 
**Location:** [[Avalon]]

- [[Saoirse]] tries to convince [[Captain Dennis Moss]] to use his ship to pursue Sumner's Hired Pirates ([[GM Story - Enemy of the Crown]]), but realizes she's not even sure if she's getting paid yet (and so can't offer that payment to Dennis.)
- She tries to contact Morton but can't reach him, so she goes looking for the ship that is bound to carry the Vesten men back to the pirates
	- She finds which dock to go to by Tempting the night watchman
	- The Vesten men are bound to depart aboard Sumner's ship *The Radiant Bounty*
	- Sumner's company is called **The Progress Company**
	- She decides on the spur of the moment to attempt to sabotage the ship so that it can't leave on schedule so that Dennis will have time to get his crew together to give chase.
	- She learns that Halla's crew aren't all on board with her alliance with Sumner, and that the Captain of the *Bounty* knows of a rednezvous with Halla's ship.
	- She is spotted by **Gundred Thorsson** and he and his crew give chase through the harbor.  She escapes them with some wounds
	- She successfully sabotaged the *Bounty*, it won't make it out of the harbor before the storm arrives, which gives Dennis' crew an advantage.
