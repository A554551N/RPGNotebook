#sessionNotes 
**Location:** [[Avalon]]

- [[Saoirse]] tries to convince [[Captain Dennis Moss]] to use his ship to pursue Sumner's Hired Pirates ([[GM Story - Enemy of the Crown]]), but realizes she's not even sure if she's getting paid yet (and so can't offer that payment to Dennis.)
- She tries to contact Morton but can't reach him, so she goes looking for the ship that is bound to carry the Vesten men back to the pirates
	- She finds which dock to go to by Tempting the night watchman
	- The Vesten men are bound to depart aboard Sumner's ship *The Radiant Bounty*
	- Sumner's company is called **The Progress Company**
	- She decides on the spur of the moment to attempt to sabotage the ship so that it can't leave on schedule so that Dennis will have time to get his crew together to give chase.
