**Location:** [[Avalon]]

*The crew arrives in Carleon after the battle with [[Mercedes Aballon]] in the Highland Straits and reunited with [[Captain Dennis Moss]] who had aided them in getting the refugee priests onto Avalonian soil.*

- The Captain and [[Saoirse]] go to dinner at an unusual restaurant in Carleon run by a Sidhe and their lesser hangers on.  At this restaurant, you pay beforehand and the cashier will return to you the excess value depending on what you order.  You can eat as much as you'd like, but you always receive the exact value of what you pay for.  It's called [[The Ever-Balanced Scale]].
- After taking the very drunk [[Captain Dennis Moss]] to her house and reuniting with her brother [[Connor Cobbler]], she finds a letter from [[Mr Morton]] on her pillow advising her that he intends to call on her while she is in port.
- (Mostly for background) Avalonian privateers in the Queen's service are given a sword on their joining the corps.  Rather than a more standard naval weapon, they are issued a cruciform hilt longsword with the image of the Graal inscribed at the cross of the guard.
- [[Saoirse]] allows the shipwright to believe she is still a member of **Elaine's Sea Dogs**.  They put the bill to the Royal Treasury.
- As she leaves her meeting with the shipwright, [[Saoirse]] spotted [[Mr Morton]] amongst a crowd of men on the dock, but he wasn't there when she looked closer.
