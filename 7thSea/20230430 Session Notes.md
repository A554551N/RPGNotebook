#sessionNotes 
**Location:** [[Avalon]]
- *Diligent* returns with no crew aboard (thanks to a Fae glamour), the docks are abuzz with rumours of it being a 'ghost ship from the 7th Sea'
- [[Gustav]] is wounded AF, trapped in and out of consciousness.  At one point he awakens and cries out "THEY'RE COMING FOR ME" before passing out again.
- Ship's Doc is named Nicolaj, he is an Ussuran barber/surgeon with the bedside manner of a brick.   All of his prescriptions include some of Mother's Borscht.
- We get a shot of the merchantman *Persephone* (daughter of Demeter) flagged with Eisen markings.  The captain reads orders to open a crate below and then to evacuate the ship for 72 hours.
