- A [[Sidhe]]-run restaurant in **Carleon**.
- It was once a noble's mansion (he lost his house in a deal with the current proprietor).
- No iron is permitted passed the guardhouse.
- You always feel like there's something moving at the corner of your eye
- Every room in the house has been converted into intmate dining chambers suitable for up to 10 guests divided between 3 to 4 tables
	- One of these rooms is the 'Yellow Room' which contains a giant oil painting of the Siege of Donega
- There is a bowl at the center of each table.  You put money in the bowl, and then the menus appear as if by magic.
	- Nothing on the menu has a price, you always get exactly what you paid for.
- There are no waiters.  At some point after announcing your order to the empty air, the guests become distracted by the fine atmosphere and conversation and then discover that the food has been sitting in front of them for a moment or two.
