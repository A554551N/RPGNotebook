The Bernoulli Family is one of the **7 Merchant-Princedoms of Vodacce**.  They operate from the [[Isle of Bernoulli]] and make their fortune through taxing trade headed inland and by being the only **Vodacce** Family permitted to trade with the **Crescent Empire**.

Their biggest rival within **Vodacce** is the [[Caligari]] Family

Recently, they elevated [[Rafe Gage]] to the rank of Baron so that he would aid them in locating the Syrneth artifact [[Stormbringer]].
