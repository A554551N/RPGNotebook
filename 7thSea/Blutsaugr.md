Literally "bloodsucker", the **Blutsaugr** is an Eisen Hexenwerke creation.  Incredibly strong and fast, they are essentially the most minor form of vampyre spawn.  They cannot create more of their kind, and are easily controlled by a mechanism of the Hexenwerker's choosing.  Left to its own devices, it will emerge and feed nightly until there is nothing else to eat.  If it is having trouble finding food, it can lay dormant as needed.
