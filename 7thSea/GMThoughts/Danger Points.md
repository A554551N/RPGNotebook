Danger Points are a currency earned by the GM during sessions of 7th Sea.  Just like [[Hero Points]] they reset to a default level (1 per PC at the table) at the beginning of every session.

## Effects of Danger Points
- +2D to a Villain Pool
- Make Raises cost 15 this round
- Activate Villain Grace/Abilities
- Apply an instance of [[Pressure]] to all Heroes in a scene
- Allow a Villain to Murder a Helpless character (all non-Heroes are always Helpless)

Danger Points are essentially just Hero Points for bad guys.  I really like the way Writer's Room (and John Wick on Starter Kit) will use Danger Points as a controlled way to add unexpected drama to a scene.  For example: in Writer's Room, the GM frequently uses danger points to introduce a new element to the scene that isn't in the players' favor.  Sometimes that element will even just be a flat 'you take a Dramatic Wound'

To me, they interact weirdly with the Villain resource Influence since many of the effects my gut wants me to spend Danger Points for are covered under Influence spends.

That said, Danger Points have a value at the table as a way to ensure that players don't feel cheated by a big dramatic swing.  While it might hurt in the moment, the players are at least mollified that their fortunes are improved by the DP spend.
