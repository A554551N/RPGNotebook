**Affiliation:** [[Bernoulli]]

Giovanni Bernoulli is the head of security for his family on the [[Isle of Bernoulli]].  Despite the fact that his appointment is quite literally nepotism, he does his best to ensure that criminals on the island are brought to justice.

## Interactions with Saoirse
He met [[Saoirse]] after the latter broke into the home of her ex-husband [[Rafe Gage]], now a recognized Baron of House Bernoulli.  The break-in left a man dead (killed by the assassin [[7thSea/Morta|Morta]]) and Giovanni took on the case personally to locate the culprit before the Baron returned from his voyage.

During the course of the investigation, Giovanni was nearly killed during a police raid on the ship that [[Morta]] had sailed in on, but was rescued by [[Egis Loneur]]

A bit of a rake, Giovanni immediately attempted to ingratiate himself to [[Saoirse]], offering her a number of inducements only available to a man of his station ('Perhaps you'd like to take a turn about the harbor at sunset on my private launch?').  He was devastated when he learned that [[Saoirse]] hadn't been entirely honest with him about her involvement in the crime at the outset.
