## Mobs & The Doom Pool
I don't think Mobs are working well with the Doom Pool mod active.  It feels like most, if not all, rolls should be the players squaring off against the Dark Side.  In the original build I had been making heavy use of Mobs to represent the big fights against Stormtroopers but I find that they're typically obstacles on the way to a more interesting goal.  In the future, I'll have a die or two representing Stormtrooper extras that can be knocked out (possibly pulled out of the Doom Pool) when I need a specific foe to represent them.
My hope in acknowledging this is that it helps me to build more dynamic scenes with goals outside of combat (getting the Tractor Beam down on Death Star I or rescuing Leia from the prison, for example).  Two dice pools beating each other up with the intent of defeating each other is likely the least interesting application of the Cortex Mechanics.
**Big Brain Thought:** Stop using Mobs for now.
