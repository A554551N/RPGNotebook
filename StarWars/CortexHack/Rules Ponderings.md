## Mobs & The Doom Pool
I don't think Mobs are working well with the Doom Pool mod active.  It feels like most, if not all, rolls should be the players squaring off against the Dark Side.  In the original build I had been making heavy use of Mobs to represent the big fights against Stormtroopers but I find that they're typically obstacles on the way to a more interesting goal.  In the future, I'll have a die or two representing Stormtrooper extras that can be knocked out (possibly pulled out of the Doom Pool) when I need a specific foe to represent them.
