## Trait Sets

|  Values  |   Roles   |    Distinctions    |
|:--------:|:---------:|:------------------:|
| Freedom  |  Leader   | Background/Species | 
| Loyalty  |   Pilot   |        Job         |
|   Hope   |  Scholar  | Quirk/Personality  |
|  Power   | Scoundrel |                    |
| Empathy  |  Soldier  |                    |
| Survival |   Tech    |                    |

### Specialties
Specialties are loosely bound to Roles.  **Multi-level specialties** are active.  There's an argument to be made that we're also using **No Skills, Just Specialties**.
### Stress & Trauma
We're set up for five primary stress tracks currently, with a sixth (The Dark Side) that only applies to Force sensitives.  That said, I think I'm going to make Corruption a primary Stress type to help enforce the heroic tone.
The Stress types are: Afraid, Angry, Exhausted, Injured, Insecure, and Corrupted.

Stress, when applied, starts at d6.  No stress can ever be reduced below d6, instead it is removed from the character.

When a character stresses out (gains stress of one type above d12), they gain a d6 of the associated Trauma.  Trauma is just like stress but substantially harder to shake off.
### Signature Assets
Signature Assets are items that belong to the character that are dice-worthy.  In this build, Signature Assets can have SFX.
