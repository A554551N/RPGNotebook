## Doom Pool - The Dark Side
To represent the ever-present threat of the Dark Side, this build uses the Doom Pool.  It begins at 2d6 for most sessions and grows as players roll hitches.
## Catalysts
I'm currently running one catalyst in the story (Neophyte).  I'm unsure if I like how that's working out.  I feel like in order for Catalysts to work as intended you need a few that are all fighting over the same thing, which hasn't really been the case here.  That said, I've really *liked* how the players can influence his **Values** by engaging him in Contests.
## Mobs
Groups of enemies (normally Stormtroopers) can be mushed together into a Mob.  I've been slowly moving away from this approach in favor of just making them Extras that get rolled alongside the **Doom Pool**.  Mobs take up a lot of screen time and I'm not sure they're earning their keep right now.  I think it might be a useful tool for helping background characters make sure they have problems to deal with.
## Action Order Initiative
During Big Damn Action moments I've kept in the option of Action Order to replace the standard **Narrative Order**.  During **Action Scenes** a player is chosen to act first in the scene, who takes an **Action** to affect the scene while another character takes a **Reaction** to avoid the outcome.  Due to the kind of inverted nature of rolls in an Action Order, the defending roll must beat the Action, rather than vice versa.
