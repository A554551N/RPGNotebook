*Relationships show how you feel about the other padawans, as well as about two people in the community who have helped you since you've arrived.  If either of the NPCs know your secret, step up this die with them for free.  Assign 1d10, 1d8 to your Relationships, any unrated Relationships start at 1d6.*

### Helping
During a round, one padawan may help another by giving them their die for that person (IE on Player 1's action, another player may hand Player 1 a die corresponding to the relationship that player has with Player 1.  A Padawan may only help ONE other character this way during a single round.)
