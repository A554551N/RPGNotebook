*After sneaking into a dig site on Yavin to determine the path towards the Grave of Knowledge, the team is captured in order to get aboard the Imperial Light Cruiser **Gladiator** which is in orbit overhead.  Aboard is an Inquisitor sent to collect the findings of the dig team, a Jedi recently captured by the Inquisitor, and a cyborg slicer looking for vengeance.*

## Oret Paz
A former Jedi currently imprisoned aboard the *Gladiator*.  He was knighted just days before Order 66, and his life was destroyed.  He's memorized the Jedi Code inside out, and doesn't know what to do now that he has to keep his skills hidden.  More than anything else, he wants a lightsaber back in his hands again.

The Neophyte gave up his name when he was recruited into the Inquisitorius and hasn't earned it back yet.  Unlike some of his compatriots, he has whole-heartedly accepted the narrative that the Jedi are responsible for the destruction of the Republic and relishes the opportunity to prove his loyalty to the Senate and the new Galactic Empire.

He believes that if he returns Oret Paz to Mustafar that he will finally be given a rank in the organization.  He would be there already if he hadn't been redirected on a priority call to collect Jedi-related artifacts from a dig site on Yavin.
