# NPCs
## Master Jerneh, The Entity in the Crystal
At the moment of his death, rather than becoming one with the Force, his lifeforce was trapped in a crystal and stored with others of its kind to ensure the next generation had access to training and knowledge.  Ancient and a bit cynical, the Entity will only share that knowledge with one it deems worthy.  While not *evil* per se, the Entity's teachings aren't remotely in line with the Jedi Code.

## [[Neophyte]]
Neophyte was the Inquisitor assigned to the Imperial Cruiser [[Gladiator]].  He was captured by the party and has been changing them while being changed in kind.  His loyalty in the Empire is shaken, but we're not sure what's going to replace it just yet.

## Narwahl
Narwahl is an Imperial Bureaucrat with a desire for advancement.  He has hired Val Pellian and other unsavory academics to recover artifacts for him so that he can offer them as gifts to the Emperor.

## [[Professor Byrec Suvan]]
He's old and wrinkled as Pellian, but prefers hired mercs to grad students.  They're both in search of the one big find that will cement their legacy forever.

## Oret Paz
A former Jedi currently imprisoned aboard the *Gladiator*.  He was knighted just days before Order 66, and his life was destroyed.  He's memorized the Jedi Code inside out, and doesn't know what to do now that he has to keep his skills hidden.  More than anything else, he wants a lightsaber back in his hands again.

# Factions
## Space Ninjas
An ancient sect of Force Users (A rival of the Entity's?) that focus on chanelling the force through their own bodies.  Rather than lightsabers, they rely on gauntlets woven of Cortosis (or made of Beskar) to deflect blows.  the gauntlets are electrified to deliver painful shocks on contact.

They seek to lay claim to the great store of knowledge that The Old Masters possessed, so as to destroy it and finally win their ancient war.

## The Shapers
The Entity's faction, masters of the most esoteric parts of the Force.  To anyone not versed in their ways, their work might be seen as sorcerous (and other sects of Force Users in the early Republic *certainly* found their work heretical.)

Their specialty is in manipulating the living Force within other beings, which is exactly as scary as it sounds.  By changing the Living Force within creatures, they could reshape those beings.  On their death, it was traditional for masters of the tradition to be sealed into a chunk of Kyber crystal so that their knowledge could be passed down to the next worthy generation.

After the arrival of the Sith and the conglomeration of the Jedi into a single monolithic order, such heretical sects were purged, and their knowledge lost to history.
