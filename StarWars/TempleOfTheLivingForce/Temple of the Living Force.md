## Intro
The group is a Republic survey team (100BBY) sent to an uncharted world to follow-up on a survey crew that's gone dark.  Their mission is to acquire data about the unusual structures on the planet, and to return that data to Coruscant for study.

Individually, each hunter has their own Drive to risk danger by coming to this place.

## Moments
- A small creature passes through its entire life-cycle before your eyes
- You feel thoughts or emotions that are not your own
- 

## Ring 1 - The Gateway
### Horrors
The entrance to the old temple appears to be tightly sealed, but the scoring of detpacks are evident, and a nearby camp indicates that the survey team passed this way.  
### Temptations
A camp set up outside of the gate indicates that the original team definitely passed this way, runic inscriptions and ancient statues declare the age of this structure to anyone even remotely qualified.

## Ring 2 - The Shifting Passages
### Horrors
Once within the Temple, the passageways shift and change seemingly without any rhyme or reason (a practitioner of the Living Force can easily follow the currents of energy toward the heart of the temple).
### Temptations
The active temple is clearly a source of great power.  As the passages shift, brief glimpses of chambers and loot can be had (libraries, crystalariums, and the like)

## Ring 3 - Eye of the Storm
### Horrors
In the Eye, the whole of the Temple is visible around the hunters.  Flickering and moving, it is the only still place within the walls.  The nexus of Living Force shapes anyone who stays here for long, revealing hidden characteristics.  *What do you see that convinces you not to trust your allies?*
### Temptations
The changes connect the hunters directly to their Drive *What about you has changed?*

## Ring 4 - Failed Experiments
*Who chose to breach the sealed door?  Why?*
### Horrors
This area of the Temple was sealed off for a reason.  Within lie the failed and half-finished experiments of the Old Masters.  Warped like picasso paintings, with limbs and variations that border on the nonsensical, the creatures know only the goal of reaching the Hall of Transformation so that they might attempt to heal themselves.
### Temptations
The level of genetic modification on display is astounding, and within the laboratory are ancient scrolls and documents describing the process.  They would be worth a fortune to the Republic if the techniques within could be mastered.

## Ring 5 - The Hall of Transformation
### Horrors
The walls of the temple are filled with niches, inside of each is the gleaming gem of an awakened soul crystal.  They look down upon you, a thousand eyes of disdain.  A larger crystal rests on a bier in the center of the darkened chamber, surrounded by runes and sigils.  *Who is worthy to learn the secrets of the Living Force?*
### Temptations
The power the hunters seek is here, as well as enough kyber crystal to build a superweapon.  If you could get it out of here you would have enough wealth to reshape the galaxy in your image.
Moreover, if you can learn the disciplines of the ones within the crystal, you could potentially be even more...
