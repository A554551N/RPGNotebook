**Location:** Where it takes place

*Egis made the delivery to Bezieu Market without his father, and ended up caught up in a bandit raid on the village.  In emulation of his hero Din'tagnan (and to impress the Musketeer Honorius), he challenged the leader of the bandits to a fight.  It didn't go well . . . *

- [[Olivain]] awakens on the farm of his brother Pierre outside of the village.  [[Honorius]] dragged him here after he was beaten unconscious.
