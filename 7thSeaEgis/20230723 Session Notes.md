**Location:** Back on the farm

*Olivain helps save the village from bandits and then returns home with the promise of sword lessons from Honorius.*

- Brother Pierre has not written to let Olivain's father know what happened in the village, so he is very angry when Olivain returns.  Olivain talks him down by reminding him that he did what he thought his father would want him to do in protecting innocent folks.
- John's friends Antoine and Charles appear when Olivain is walking to his sister's.  They drag him behind the barn.
