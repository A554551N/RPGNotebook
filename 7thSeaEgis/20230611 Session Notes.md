**Location:** Where it takes place

*After freeing Gaspard from the fleshmongers, Olivain returns to the farm . . .*

- Olivain's father doesn't want to make the annual trip to Bazieu to sell produce because his sister is getting ready to have a baby, but he won't let Olivain take the shipment alone because he doesn't trust Olivain to do a good job
	- Olivain steals the cart and some money and snuck out while his sister is giving birth so that his father can't come with him.
- On the way to the village, Olivain gets into a verbal altercation with another farmer's son named John.  John thinks Olivain should stop hitting on his sister Miriam.  Olivain thinks John should mind his own fucking business.
