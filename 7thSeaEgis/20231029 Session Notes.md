# 20231029 Session Notes
**Location:** Chareuse, Montaigne
*[[Gaspard]] is caught between love and duty.*

- On returning to the manor, [[Olivain]] spots a man skulking around [[Lady Genevieve]]'s room.  Sure this is the mystery suitor that Antoinette mentioned, he gives chase.
- After a brief tussle, [[Olivain]] ends up with the mystery man's cloak.  The nametag inside declares it the property of an **O. Hautang**.
- [[Gaspard]] is still being a salty little bitch when [[Olivain]] returns from pursuing the man who is trying to steal away his meal ticket (that is, Genevieve).
- Seeing that he cannot be reasoned with, [[Olivain]] instead decides to needle his friend and then go  find some dinner.
- He meets [[Lady Genevieve]]'s servant Alys in the kitchen and together they concoct a plan to get rid of monsieur Hautang and ensure the marriage between [[Gaspard]] and [[Lady Genevieve]]  goes off as planned.
- The next morning [[Gaspard]] offers to take [[Olivain]] to Musketeer HQ, [[Olivain]] is thrilled.
