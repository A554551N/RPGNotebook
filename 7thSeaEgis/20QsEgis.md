This notion was instilled in him after one of the King's Musketeers protected his father and him from bandits when they traveled to the city to deliver goods a number of years ago.

Egis isn't necessarily a patriot.  He's enamored of the *concept* of nobility as exemplified by the stories of Montaigne heroes, he believes in l'Empereur as a keeper of honor and nobility exemplified.  In short, he's very into the *idea* of Montaigne even as he's painfully aware of how much the peasantry has been harmed by the nobility.

## Does your Hero have any prejudices?
