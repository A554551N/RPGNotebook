# Themes
7th Sea is a game about daring Heroes and dangerous Villains.  I want to emphasize the capabilities of the Heroes (and their Heroic nature) and the danger of Villains.  I want to maintain as much of the vibe of 7th Sea as possible.

# Traits
## Attributes
- Brawn
- Finesse
- Resolve
- Panache

## Skills
I have some concern that the Skill list will make heroes feel...unheroic, since it sort of pigeon-holes them.  I could offer a few extra starting Die steps
- Aim
- Athletics
- Brawl
- Convince
- Empathy
- Hide
- Intimidate
- Notice
- Performance
- Ride
- Sailing
- Scholarship
- Tempt
- Theft
- Warfare
- Weaponry

## Distinctions
- Background
- Job
- Quirk

## Abilities
I'm considering using **Abilities** to cover the nifty bits of the setting.  Abilities to cover the various Dueling schools and Magic types.  Could also include some additional options like **Master Merchant** or **Sea Captain**.  I would dig into the Advantage list from 7th Sea to help come up with new ones.

For Duelling at least (if not Magic) I'd probably write a handful of generic SFX, as well as a couple that capture the feel of each School.

# Villains
I want to try to capture the feel of rising and falling Villain influence using a form of the **Catalyst** rules I'm tentatively calling the **Villainy Die**.  I'd like to have it start at a default value, and then have it step up or down as the Villain succeeds at or fails at Schemes.  I think that would end up looking a lot like **Goals**, but for Villains.  I'd probably write a special **Villain SFX** that allows the Villain to step down his Villainy to hire goons, bring on subordinate villains, or to escape conflict with their life!  Figuring out where to start the Villain die when they appear onscreen is a bit of a challenge there.  I'd assume that Villains would default to a d8 **Villainy**.  I'm debating having the Villainy die work as **Scale** to help them stand up to multiple opponents.

## Villain Traits
In addition to **Villainy**, I've considered having Villains be set up with **Values** rather than Attributes + Skills like the Heroes.  My first pass at it was to use the 7 Deadly Sins, which works in large but I have some concern about Villains that have a high Sloth (for example) and the mechanical difference between Gluttony and Greed.

The idea is sound though, and I'm very interested in an asymmetrical stat blocks for Villains.

## Villain Schemes
Villains would be made with an **Endgame** in mind.  Cardinal Richelieu desires to beccome undisputed ruler of France.  In order to reach it, they must engage in schemes (Separate the King and Queen, Disband the Musketeers, etc).  Each successfully executed Scheme increases their **Villainy** and brings them one step closer to their ultimate victory.
# Ships
Ships would be fully realized **Vehicles** (Sails, Guns, Hull) with Distinctions (Origin,Background,Special Feature) and SFX based on the Distinctions (for example the Avalonian advantage to speed and maneuverability)

Since Naval actions are a core of the setting, I'd like to make sure this part of the game feels great.  Naval scenes should definitely come with built-in **Scene Distinctions** to add interest to the scene (gaining the **Wind** advantage might require making a Test agairunst the opponent to get the Weather Gage, or you might use the **Jagged Rocks** to help get away from a more dangerous opponent)

# Stories & XP
I would use a form of the **Milestone** system to allow players to define their own story arc.  The GM could also produce Adventure Stories to flesh out the world.
