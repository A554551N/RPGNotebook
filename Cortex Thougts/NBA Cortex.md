# Other Traits
**Assign two Resources, and either two Specialties & One Signature Asset or vice versa**
## Resources
**Assign two 2d6 Resources w/ two tags each**
Resources give the spy access to NPCs who can help them, places to retreat to, or allied organizations to return to.  They add a number of d6 to rolls, which are **added to the total** and **cannot roll hitches**.
- An Agent who has the **Seward Serum** SFX MUST take a Resource with the group that supplies their Serum.
- An Agent who has taken the **Renfield** SFX MUST take a Resource that represents their Vampiric Master.
## Specialties
**Assign one OR two d8 Specialties to Roles**
Specialties are specific applications of a Role such as *Hand to Hand Combat* or *Firearms* 
## Signature Assets
**Assign one OR two d6 Signature Asset**
Signature Assets are physical things (like *My Favorite Gun* or *A Picture of my Wife*) that can give you advantages during a mission.  Signature Assets may be temporarily lost but always seem to find their way back to the Agent.
## Vampiric Shadow (Corruption)
Unlocked via the *Seward Serum* or *Renfield* SFX, *Vampiric Shadow* is a stress die that is added to applicable rolls, but can be pushed by characters to add it to their pool at the cost of stepping it up.  If a player Stresses out on *Shadow*, they're out of the scene and the Vampire connected to the Serum, or the Vampire that made the Renfield is in control of the body.

During a Test or Contest of Vampiric Influence, a failure on the PCs part will most likely step up Vampiric Shadow in addition to other consequences of failure.

# Mechanics
## Heat (Special Crisis Pool)
The *Heat Pool* represents global agencies' attempts to track down your character.  It begins at 2d6 and cannot ever be reduced below 2d6.  It can be Tested against as per the standard rules for Crisis Pools to reduce dice from the Heat pool.

The Heat Pool is tested against when a character needs to do things that would require identification, such as:
- Crossing national lines
- Purchasing controlled materials
- Entering Government facilities

When players roll **Hitches**, the GM may choose to add those dice to the Heat Pool when collateral damage or leftover evidence of the character's presence makes sense.  The Player is rewarded with PP per the rules for increasing the size of a Doom Pool.
When a Heat test is failed, the GM may move any dice out of the Heat pool (the GM always gets at least 1d6, even if this would normally reduce the pool below 2d6) and use them to create GMCs and Scene Complications as the agencies take a crack at bringing you in.
## Aberrance (Boss Pools)
Vampires have access to a Boss trait called Aberrance.  The size of the pool depends on the power (determining size of the dice) and the age (determining number of dice).  Vampires can only be defeated by removing all dice from their Aberrance pool.  Dice are removed from the pool when they drop below **d6**
### Vampiric Power
Vampires can step down a die in their Aberrance pool to utilize the standard suite of Vampiric powers (teleport, turn to mist, shapeshift, charm, etc)
A Vampire may always spend a **full die** of their Aberrance to escape a scene **unless prevented from doing so by Banes or Blocks**.
### Victims
Biting a helpless victim and drinking their blood allows the Vampire to step up one die in their Aberrance pool (or add a new die if their dice are maxed out).  Vampires may never have more Aberrance dice than their initial value.
## SFX: Renfield/Seward Serum
*Push the **Vampiric Shadow** Stress die to use this ability*.
During the scene that **Renfield** is activated, you may step up or double the Attribute die in your roll in addition to the normal benefits of pushing Stress (on the roll where this ability is activated).  Your senses and physical capabilities are heightened to the absolute limits of human possibility.

You may **not** activate **Renfield** in a Test or Contest to resist Vampiric Influence, you may **not** push Vampiric Shadow to resist Vampiric Influence.
### Recovering from Vampiric Shadow
Recovering from *Vampiric Shadow* is a Hard (2d8) Test that adds your current **Vampiric Shadow**.  Success steps down the dice per the standard rule, but once the **Renfield** SFX is unlocked, you may never have a *Vampic Shadow* lower than d6.
### Becoming Human Again
The effects of tasting a vampire's blood are largely permanent, but if the fiction would present you an opportunity to remove the **Renfield** SFX, you may then fully Recover from *Vampiric Shadow* using the standard Recovery rules.
