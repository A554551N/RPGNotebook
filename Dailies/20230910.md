# 20230910 Session Notes
**Location:** [[Lady Genevieve]]'s house | Chareuse, Montaigne
*[[Gaspard]] has brought [[Olivain]] to the city before immediately dumping his friend on the young noble's betrothed.  [[Olivain]] took her around while he did his chores and then returned to the manor hoping that [[Gaspard]] had returned.*
## Notes
- [[Gaspard]] reveals to [[Olivain]] that he has been secretly seeing a commoner, which is why he had to be in Chareuse today.
- [[Olivain]] jokingly suggests that he marry the commoner and then he and [[Gaspard]] could swap.  [[Gaspard]] has taken this very seriously.  [[Olivain]] is concerned.
- [[Gaspard]] leaves by jumping off the balcony to go and see his lover.
