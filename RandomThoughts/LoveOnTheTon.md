# Love on the Ton
*An attempt at making DitV work for Bridgerton style Regency Romance*

**VERSION 0.1**

## Changes From Core DOGS
- Addition of **Heart's Desire** and **Secret/Shame** to help drive players into conflict (since the core assumption of DitV includes a strong drive toward them game's themes).
- There is no permanent GM, and a journalling role (The Society Pages) has been added.
- Conflicts have different consequences & triggers.  The swap between conflict types is substantially hazier than it is in core DitV.  My initial thoughts is that a valid pool must have one of either Grace or Wit, and one of either Charm or Passion (though it occurs to me that some conflicts may just be Charm & Passion for example).  Since the primary form of damage is social harm (it's rare for anyone to come to actual injury), I think the players can just decide on the initial stakes of the conflict which sets the die appropriately.

## Stats
### Body / Grace
Grace represents physical activities.  Given the setting, raw strength isn't typically prized but skill with a gun or fencing foil is.  Grace is also the stat used for dancing.

### Mind / Wit
Wit is half of a good conversation.  Wit is knowing things and having a repartee ready to fire.  Understanding the complex connections of the Peerage is Wit, as is knowing who's in and who's out of favor.

### Soul / Charm
The other half of good conversation.  Charm is charisma and empathy, as the ability to use it.  No one regrets having a decent score in Charm.

### Spirit / Passion
A character's Passion is their drive, their willingness to endanger their prospects to seek the thing they desire most.  It covers tenacity, aggressiveness, and determination.

> I'm not married to these stats but I think it covers most common conflicts for this era

## Traits/Relationships/Powers/Equipment
- No powers in Ton
- Traits as per DOGS, not sure what to use for the *Spiritual* background since that's really for powers.
- Relationships as per DOGS.  Include a value statement with your relationship.  Not just "My elder sister Elena" but, "My elder sister Elena, who everyone else thinks is perfect."
- Equipment as per DOGS, your Family is a Relationship, not an Equipment.  Your estate though, is absolutely equipment.
- Training Conflicts, perhaps do the preparations for the first ball of the season as a training conflict?

## Conflicts
- This gets fuzzy, I think that prescribing pairings of stats for fight types is unlikely to get me anywhere.
- The starting die type for consequences should be agreed on by the combatants at the outset (guided by the fiction).  When a player escalates, they begin using (by default) the next die size up unless they specifically call for a larger one.  Fictional actions must correlate to the increased damage.
- Conflicts in Ton are more likely than base DitV to use 'stretchy time', that is to say that each move of a conflict may play out over several hours or days rather than being moment-to-moment conflict.  This becomes increasingly true for social actions taken at higher consequence levels.

### Consequence Levels & Pairings
- Suggested Consequence Levels:
	- A private argument/Persuasion/Flirtation - d4
	- A public argument, rejection, minor shaming,  - d6
	- A public snub or shaming, a beating - d8
	- Figurative (Social) or literal murder - d10
- Suggested Pairings for Conflicts:
	- **Flirtation** Wit & Charm
	- **Argument** Wit & Passion
	- **Dancing** Grace & Passion
	- **Fencing** Grace & Wit
	- **Fighting** Grace & Passion

## Desires & Shames
- Every character has both a **Desire** and a **Shame**, acheiving or fully refuting your Desire earns you **Growth** (the Growth you choose should reflect how you have changed as a result).  Having a secret aired also causes **Growth** (should reflect how you have changed).  If you choose to reveal your secret yourself, you **Grow**, but also get a 3d10 trait with the same tag as your secret to use in conflict *right now*.  Revealing your secret is **always** an Escalation (to a die level equivalent to the kind of secret revealed).

> I'm not sure if **3d10** is too big of a boost for revealing their Shame, but I feel like a big reward is in order to encourage players to do it.
> I also need to consider how characters get new Desires and Shames.

## NPCs
Not every PC will be in every scene.  When a PC is off-screen, the player may take up the role of a created NPC or grab an unfinished NPC from the table to play until their character returns.

>This is intended to keep players engaged when it isn't 'their turn', and also to allow for every player to play a noble character while ensuring there are plenty of 'supporting cast' to interact with.  Roles like Madame Delacroix, Walter Mondale, the housekeepers, grooms, and footmen can all be covered with NPC templates.

## Narrator
The role of **Narrator** moves around the table.  At the end of each scene, one of the participants of the current conflict should take up the role of Narrator for the next scene.  The Narrator sets the scene (who, where, when, why) and establishes the scene goal with input from the rest of the table and the fiction as established.  While the Narrator's PC may be in the scene, they should not be the focal point.  The Narrator's duty is to turn the spotlight on other PCs and introduce complications into their lives.  The Narrator plays any NPCs not taken up by other players (see above).

The role of Narrator switches after a conflict is resolved.  No player may ever fulfil the role of **Narrator** for two conflicts in a row.

> I'm doing this to help keep conflicts small (1v1 where possible) and to reaffirm that not every character needs to be together all of the time.  This pairs with the NPC rules above to enforce that expectation.

## The Society Pages
Nominate one player each session to take on the role of **The Society Pages**, their job is to make a note of each conflict and its results for later review.  The player in charge of **The Society Pages** can add as much or as little color to the events they're recording as they choose.  

For the session that they are **The Society Pages**, their character gets a 1d10 trait "The Society Pages" that can be used in conflict where knowledge of what scandals have been in recent issues would be useful.

The role of **The Society Pages** must move to another player at the beginning of the next session.  No player may ever fulfil the role of **The Society Pages** twice in a row.

> If this game is going to run longer than baseline DitV, remembering the conflicts we've fought and what was gained or lost will be important.  Additionally, in the source material, the illicit society papers that everyone is reading shapes the tale dramatically.
> I included a reward for the **S**ociety **P**ages (SP) player because it is an additional ask of them and I want players to desire the opportunity to add to the document.

## House
Rather than the default 1d6 *I'm a Dog* trait, each player begins play with a 1d6 trait with their last name.  Players should choose a few key features of their family that determine when the name can be brought into play.  Players of characters from the same family should work together to determine their Name Traits.

>We'll see how this ends up looking.  My original thought was just **1d6** The Peerage, but I feel like this ties into the source material better.
