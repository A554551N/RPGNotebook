# Story
Charnam always knew he was destined for greatness, he also knew he'd have to go remind destiny of that fact.  Never much for hard work, he grifted his way from place to place, making enough coin to get by and moving on.  It wasn't much, but it was honest work.

Eversink changed everything.

One night in the city and he knew he'd never leave it.  He changed his game, smaller scores that wouldn't get him chased out of town.  He made friends in the alehouses and enemies of minor nobles, but he knew destiny was still waiting for him.  That was the night he accidentally robbed a Triskadane, one of the Thirteen anonymous rulers of Eversink.  It was a standard deal, brush passed, grab a coin purse, move on...he'd done it a hundred times.  This time, his eyes caught on a gleaming silver pocketwatch sticking *just a little* too far out of a coat pocket.  He grabbed it, and when he opened it found a thick gold coin wedged inside the case.

The rest of the day was a blur, the Coin taught him more about the city in a heartbeat than years in the slums had.  He knew byways and hidden passages no one else could possible have found, he knew secrets of the City's history.  He also knew that there was work to be done.

By dawn, one of the City's oldest guilds was aflame, its members dead or in hiding, and the Coin was gone.  It must have fallen out of his pocket while he was raiding the guild and burning down the guildhouse.  Only he (and presumably the other Triskadane) knew that the guild was a front for a group of sorcerers who were planning on bringing doom to the eternal city.  The Coin chose him, he acted, and then it left him.

Now to find another Triskadane to get his Coin back.
