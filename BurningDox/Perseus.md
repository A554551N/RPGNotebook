# Perseus
*Perseus is 20 and has recently begun exhibiting signs of magical talent.  About the same time, a band of soldiers from the enemy land of **Enkavma** arrived to take him into custody.  With help from his sister [Cassandra](../Cassandra.md) and his best friend [Melanion](../Melanion.md), he escaped their clutches and is now grappling with his destiny in Trokos.*

## Beliefs
- Once [Cassandra](../Cassandra.md) is settled comfortably in Trokos, she'll forget all about **Sebastian**.  She'll forget even faster if I find her a real Trokosi man.  Maybe [Melanion](../Melanion.md)'s friend [Skata](TrokosNPCs#skata)?
- I didn't ask to be a sorcerer, let alone Archmage!  If I can just find a way to trick the Council into testing someone else, I can go back to my old life.
