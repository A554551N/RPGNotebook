# The City-State of Trokos
## NPCs
### Delia
*Delia is [Perseus](NPCs/OtherNPCs#perseus) and [Cassandra](../Cassandra.md)'s Aunt.  She is a weaver in Trokos and the center of a web of middle-class friends that she interacts with through regular meetings to play [Diaskedazo](../WorldNotes#diaskedazo)*

#### Beliefs
- I nearly put [Cassandra](../Cassandra.md) into the hands of a predator.  I will ensure that she is never put into danger again.
- [Perseus](OtherNPCs#perseus) will need someone near him who understands the ways of the world if he is to survive.  I will teach [Cassandra](../Cassandra.md)
- [Cassandra](BurningDox/Cassandra.md) TEST
### Exarch Andros
*The Exarch is the civic ruler of the city of Trokos.  He currently rules alongside the **Archon Stylvanius**.  His daughter is **Phaedra**.  Andros is handsome, middle-aged, and a consumate (if authoritarian) politicion.  He and Stylvanius make an effective team, even if they rarely see eye to eye.*

#### Beliefs
- [Perseus](NPCs/OtherNPCs#perseus) is a danger to us all, no matter what the Archon thinks.  I will find a way to prove it to the City.

### Archon Stylvanius
*The Archon is the foreign and military ruler of the city of Trokos.  He is responsible for managing affairs concerning State security, foreign relations, and warfare.  It is this last that the current Archon has hung his helmet on.  Stylvanius, also known as 'The Shark of Trokos', is widely regarded as the greatest general in the Thousand Isles.  He has held his seat as Archon since the year after the previous Archmage's death (19 years, 9.5 terms).*
*The Archon's cunning is well-known, and it is said he would sacrifice anything to end the war on his own terms.*

#### Beliefs
- [Perseus](NPCs/OtherNPCs#perseus) represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Trokos.  He must be groomed to serve Trokos first and only.
- Any cost we must pay to defeat the Alliance once and for all is worth it.
