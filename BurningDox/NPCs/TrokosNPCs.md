# The City-State of Trokos
## NPCs
### Delia
*Delia is [Perseus](../Perseus.md) and [Cassandra](../Cassandra.md)'s Aunt.  She is a weaver in Trokos and the center of a web of middle-class friends that she interacts with through regular meetings to play [Diaskedazo](../WorldNotes#diaskedazo) and trade rumors.*

#### Beliefs
- I nearly put [Cassandra](../Cassandra.md) into the hands of a predator.  I will ensure that she is never put into danger again.
- [Perseus](../Perseus.md) will need someone near him who understands the ways of the world if he is to survive.  I will teach [Cassandra](../Cassandra.md) more than weaving so that she can be what he needs.

### Skata
*Skata is a bureaucrat working in the Office of Military Logistics.  Officially his job is locating food for the troops and making sure the food ends up where it's supposed to go.  Unofficially, Skata is a spy working on behalf of the [Alliance](../WorldNotes.md) to destabilize Trokos from within.*
*He is interested in [Melanion](../Melanion.md) as an asset.  So blindly loyal to Trokos that he might be willing to do some really terrible stuff if he believes it's for the good of the City.*

#### Beliefs
- Now that [Melanion](../Melanion.md) is working for my office, I will begin by having him handle relatively innocuous work while convincing him of a plot to overthrow the Archon (lies, of course).
- I'm not sure what to make of [Cassandra](../Cassandra.md).  I will make her into a friend to ensure I have an in with the Archmage.

### Exarch Andros
*The Exarch is the civic ruler of the city of Trokos.  He currently rules alongside the **Archon Stylvanius**.  His daughter is **Phaedra**.  Andros is handsome, middle-aged, and a consumate (if authoritarian) politicion.  He and Stylvanius make an effective team, even if they rarely see eye to eye.*

#### Beliefs
- [Perseus](../Perseus.md) is a danger to us all, no matter what the Archon thinks.  I will find a way to prove it to the City.

### Archon Stylvanius
*The Archon is the foreign and military ruler of the city of Trokos.  He is responsible for managing affairs concerning State security, foreign relations, and warfare.  It is this last that the current Archon has hung his helmet on.  Stylvanius, also known as 'The Shark of Trokos', is widely regarded as the greatest general in the Thousand Isles.  He has held his seat as Archon since the year after the previous Archmage's death (19 years, 9.5 terms).*
*The Archon's cunning is well-known, and it is said he would sacrifice anything to end the war on his own terms.*

#### Beliefs
- [Perseus](../Perseus.md) represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Trokos.  He must be groomed to serve Trokos first and only.
- Any cost we must pay to defeat the Alliance once and for all is worth it.

### Iosef
*Counsellor Iosef is the pre-eminent scholar of legal matters in the city.  A friend of **Aunt Delia**'s, she thought he would be a good match to help with the case.  Instead it turns out he's a real sleazeball.  If he's taking advantage of women, who knows what else he's doing?*
*Someone beat up Cassandra in his name.*

#### Beliefs
- [Cassandra](../Cassandra.md) came into my house, **into MY HOUSE**, and ratted on me to **MY WIFE!**  This bitch is going to learn her place.

## Minor NPCs
- **Counsellor Theofylaktos** - a young legal counsellor who aided the group in their meeting with the archon.  A friend of **Skata**.
- **One-Eyed Stevos** - Old, barely four foot tall, big beard, one eye.  Runs the fight club on the docks.
- **Phaedra** - Daughter of the **Exarch**, currently attending university.  Trying to get with [Perseus](../Perseus.md).  [Melanion](../Melanion.md) is trying to get with her.
- **Moustaki** - A random pita vendor
