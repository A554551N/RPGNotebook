# Notes
## Challenging Beliefs
### Melanion
- Schedule a qualifying race for the same time as Percy's Testing

### Cassandra
- Cassandra is aggressively rejecting the Hero's Journey, [Aunt Delia](NPCs/TrokosNPCs.md#delia) is going to turn her into a mistress of intrigue (and voice of reason) to work at Perseus' side and protect him.
	- I see this working as a process wherein Delia invites her to join [Diaskedazo](WorldNotes.md#diaskedazo) games and shows her friends.  Make a point of showing how Delia learns things from the games, and how she seems to always have the right friend for any occasion.
- Iosef wants to put the hurt on Cassandra
	- How bad will he hurt Aunt Delia to make it happen?
