# Cassandra
## Beliefs
* Behind every powerful man, is a more powerful woman.
* Now that Percy is preparing to be trained, I will make sure he doesn't do anything stupid, that could get him hurt or killed.
* I will not let men take advantage or harass any woman in my presence, I will not accept anything less than full safety for them; I will start with where I know is a problem, and find a way to hit [Iosef](NPCs/TrokosNPCs.md#Iosef) where it hurts, either his pride, his pocket, or his social rank.
