## Beliefs
* Now that I'm to become [Aunt Delia](NPCs/TrokosNPCs#delia)'s apprentice, I will make sure I do my best not to disappoint her.
* Now that the [Exarch](NPCs/TrokosNPCs#exarch-andros) knows what [Percy](NPCs/OtherNPCs#perseus) is. I will ensure he is given the respect the title deserves, and the training he needs to go forward.
