# Melanion
## Beliefs
- Any wizard deserves a staff - I'll make Percy a symbol of office he can be proud of, with my own two hands. 
- Service to my city comes before all. I'll serve [Skata](NPCs/TrokosNPCs.md#Skata) to the best of my abilities, for the good of the city, but I won't stop there - I'll find some way to enter the Archon's service
- The Games are coming up - and I want to win a Laurel in the marathon. I must be ready. Whatever competition is coming up next, I'll win.
