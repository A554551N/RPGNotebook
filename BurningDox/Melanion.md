# Melanion
## Beliefs
- I'm going before the [Archon](NPCs/TrokosNPCs#archon-stylvanius).  This is my chance - to prove my loyalty and patriotism before Trokos' leading Elder.  I **must** impress him.
- We're finally in Trokos!  Percy needs help, and we need money - The most honest way to both is through service to my City.  I'll serve [Skata](NPCs/TrokosNPCs#skata) to the best of my ability for the good of the city.
- The Games are coming up - I want to win a laurel in the run, so I must be ready.  Whatever competition is coming up next, I'll win!
