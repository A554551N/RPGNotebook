## Welcome
- Thanks for Coming
- CATS
	- Concept - Ghost/Monster hunters in 19th Century Scandinavia
	- Aim - Tell a dramatic story about monsters and spooky stuff.  We all win if the story is good!   More granularly we should expect sessions focused on Mystery and we play to find out what happens to our characters.
	- Tone - Vaesen is pretty darn serious.  Moments of levity are ok but I'd like to do as much as we can to maximize the spook vibes
	- Subject Matter - I don't have any immediate callouts, but Vaesen is a horror game so we should expect the basic tenets of horror and for the characters to experience trauma
- Safety Tools
	- Results of the RPG Consent Survey
	- Script Change Overview
- Game Format
	- Monster of the Week with a check-in to 'renew' the show at the end of each Mystery.
