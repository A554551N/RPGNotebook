Sandro is a witty, 20 year-old satirist, writing poetry that lampoons the government of Giovanni Villanova.  He is a member of the Sisters of Sophia, who help Fate Witches escape from Vodacce, and advocate for better treatment of women in the country.
He was drawn into the original conflict around the [[Countess]] by a Fate Witch's prophecy (a woman he belives was his mother), and ended up being responsible for inadvertently aiding the [[Countess]] in killing her brother Jean-Paul.

# Story Ideas
- Sandro met Violetta, a young Vodacce woman who reads enough of his poetry to recognize his style when she hears it at Varnham's Wake.
	- She's always wanted to be with someone famous
	- She's going to tell *everyone* that she was with someone famous
	- Someone will believe her...eventually
 - With all the people in town for Varnham's Wake it stands to reason their might be a Fate Witch in need of the Sisterhood's service.
