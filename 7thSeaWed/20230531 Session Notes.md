- The original crew includes:
	-  ~~Jonathan Varnham (Knight of Avalon)~~ Dead by suicide
	- ~~Jean-Paul d'Plamandon (Montaigne Courtier)~~ Dead by knife

	- [[Nikola]] Nurmagomedov (Ussuran Knight)
	- [[Sandro]] di Giovanni (Vodacce Satirist)
- [[Countess Daniele Lucette D'Plamondon|Daniele]]'s sister is named Margaux
- The party infiltrates the village of [[Geistwynd]] and interrupts the blood rite.  Jean-Paul is killed by Daniele before succumbing to her wounds.
- The party reunites 10 years later in the city of Wandesboro in Avalon for the funeral of Jonathan Varnham (Knight of Avalon)
	- The party is met by **Tristan Price**, local head of the Explorers' Society and Jonathan's lover.
	- They've been invited to stay at Varnham's house
	- After being settled in, the group searches the house for signs of what happened.  [[Bolvangr]] finds a secret panel in the armory (accessed by turning the helmet on one of the knight armor sets) behind which is a pepe silvia conspiracy board detailing Varnham's search for [[Countess Daniele Lucette D'Plamondon|the Countess]]'s prison.
	- [[Sandro]] found a book of his own satire in Varnham's study.  Inside is a letter from the warden of La Buca informing Varnham that the 'prisoner was still secure beneath the island'.  He also found a letter written in ~~red ink~~ **blood** that says "I haven't forgotten you" with a date a little over a week ago.
	- Tristan tells the group that after receiving the letter, Varnham went into a frenzy of drinking and preparation.  It worried Tristan immensely.  A few days prior to the party's arrival, Varnham was found in the armory holding a gun with a bullet hole in his head.
- Next session will open with an **Action Sequence** in the Underwater Syrneth Ruin where the knife comes from.
