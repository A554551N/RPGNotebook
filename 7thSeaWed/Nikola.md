Nikola has been given Grandmother's Gifts, and in return is required to practice kindness and forgiveness.  His father was a warrior of great renown, and he was harried in his latter days by a Vesten fighter called [[Conor Kjartansson]], who believed that the Vesten school was superior to Nurmagomedov's.

**I need to gather some more background on Nikola**

# Story Ideas
- Nikola fought Conor for the first time and defeated him handily.  Nikola offered him a rematch at the Circle of Kings in Vendel in a fortnight.
- [[Conor Kjartansson|Conor]] was then approaced by the [[Countess]] and [[Rufino]] to help in their plot against the Vendel Mint.
