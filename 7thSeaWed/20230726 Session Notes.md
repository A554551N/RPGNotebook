- They deal with the burning building.  The house is lost but the people are safe.  They discover that Tristan was removed from the house via Porte.
- [[Bolvangr]] immediately flies off the handle and plans to immediately kill the [[Countess]] regardless of her status as the Queen's Ambassador.
	- [[Sandro]] and [[Nikola]] calm him down as they make their way to the Queen's ship.
	- [[Bolvangr]] stops at a small embroidery shop along the way with no warning (a comrade in Mociutes Skara).  He asks her to have the Shawl's representatives keep tabs on her while she is in Avalon.
- [[Nikola]] talks to a mouse who saw the kidnapping, it directs him to the Queen's ship in the harbor.
