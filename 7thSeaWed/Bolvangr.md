Bolvangr is an Eisen tired of war.  He left his homeland to serve Mistress of the Breifa Elisif Geirsdattir as head of security for the Breifa (the Vendel Mint) in Vestenmannavenjar.  He is a duelist of the Eisenfaust school.

## Story Ideas
Bolvangr is currently part of a story about traitors working against the Vendel League in the mint.  The first step is to make security arrangements while he is away.

- A Warfare Risk to determine the most likely points of attack for the Mint.
	- Raw Materials have to enter the Mint somehow, 
	- The areas above the Mint in the Breifa are less privileged, intruders could get that deep and then just have to know how to access the Mint
- [[Countess]] will hire [[Conor Kjartansson]] and his raiders to act as catspaws on her raid on the mint.  She will use her wealth to purchase a Chair in order to be invited to the Gala at the Breifa, then use Porte to make a Mark she can Walk them to later as the party winds down.  To ensure success, she will give a vial of her blood to Rufino to make a second Mark in case the first is discovered.
- Bolvangr is a member of Mociutes Scara (the anti-war people).  I should take a look at the Favor gains for them and figure out what I can do about offering him favor.
