*La Madre de Dios* is a heavily-armed frigate commanded by the notorious [[Juan Cardoza]].  While it ostensibly belongs to the Navy, it has essentially been given over to the Abarquero-Cardoza clan's personal use.

It was badly damaged in heavy fighting against the smaller ship **El Santo del Esturion** during the Affair at Isle de Castille, and received repairs at the naval shipyard in Maracaibo.
