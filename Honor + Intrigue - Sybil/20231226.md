# 20231226 Session Notes
**Location:** The Spanish Stronghold of Havana
*Sybil arrives in Havana as a sailor aboard a reputable Spanish merchant ship.  She is seeking the Royal Mail with an eye toward grabbing it before it is loaded in with the  rest of the treasure and delivered to Spain.*
- [[Sybil]] arrives in Havana and sees the Treasure Fleet already being loaded for the return trip to Spain, by her estimate she has less than three days to recover the letters before they're safely aboard and on its way to Spain
- She takes a bed at **El Hombre Grande**, a shitty dockside tavern
- After this, she stakes out the warehouse and sees it protected by around a dozen patrolling guards and officers.  The warehouse is a hotbed of activity as laborers load the last boats bound for the treasure fleet.  She decides to hire some high-class whores to distract the guards.
> She scores a **MIghty Success**
