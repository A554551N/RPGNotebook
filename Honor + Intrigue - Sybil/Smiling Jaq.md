# "Smiling" Jaqueline MacGregor
**Nationality**: Scotland
**Ship**: [[Bonnie Day]]

Jaqueline MacGregor gets her nickname for her nigh-legendary lack of smiling, and a pair of brutal scares on her cheeks that gives her the look of a grinning loon.

She's a Scot, and has been plying the sealanes as a pirate for around three years.  The man who gave her the scars was a British naval officer, and she tracked him to the Caribbean and killed him, taking his ship in the process.

Her Ship's First Mate is **Mr. Mulligan**, a very large black man (think Barbados Slim)
