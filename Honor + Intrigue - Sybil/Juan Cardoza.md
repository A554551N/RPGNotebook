# Juan Cardoza
**Nationality:** Spain
Juan Cardoza is the brother of [[Isadora Abarquero-Cardoza]] and an instrument of the family will.  While [[Isadora Abarquero-Cardoza|Isadora]] is distant and influential, Juan is potent and direct.  A master of the Spanish Style, Cardoza is a fierce combatant who fights with brutal cunning, emphasizing patient parries and blinding ripostes.

He's nearly captured [[Sybil]] on a number of occasions, most recently in the Affair at Isle de Castille.
## Encounters with Sybil
- Used [[El Mapache]] as a catspaw to capture [[Sybil]] and take her to **Isle de Castille**
