# 20240114 Session Notes
**Location:** Petit-Goave
*In Which the Abarquero-Cardozas lure pirates to their banner to vote out the Pirate King*

- [[Sybil]] and [[Juan Cardoza]] are brought before the Governor so that he can sort out the fight between them (see [[20240101]]).
	- Seeing that he has been trapped by the evidence [[Sybil]] has already provided to the Governor, [[Juan Cardoza]] throws a knife (scoring a mighty success with -4 Called Shot) that is fated to kill the Governor when [[Jean-Paul]] leaps in front of the blade.  It strikes him fatally.
	- [[Juan Cardoza]] flees from the scene, with [[Sybil]] in pursuit.  They meet again in the city streets after a brief chase that culminates with [[Sybil]] cutting [[Juan Cardoza|Cardoza's]] escape rope and spilling him to the street.
	- They spar verbally and with blades, but [[Sybil]] ultimately lets [[Juan Cardoza]] escape, saying that she doesn't want to fight him "when he is not at his best".  She doesn't realize yet that [[Jean-Paul]] has taken the blow for the Governor.
	- When she returns, she finds a surgeon attending to the fallen [[Jean-Paul]], but he doesn't have the skill to save him.  [[Jean-Paul]] dies from his wounds on the cobbles of the Governor's Mansion.
