**Location:** Petit-Goave
*In Which the Enemy brings violence to the shores of Petit-Goave in order to force the Governor's hand . . .*

- After bedding [[Jean-Paul]], [[Sybil]] is awakened by the sounds of fighting, fire, and alarm bells.
- Jean-Paul heads off to the Governor's mansion to protect the Governor, [[Sybil]] chases down a gang of pirates who are hunting a woman down a dark alley.
	- She ends up fighting a small gang of pirates headed up by an absolute unit of a man wielding a crane hook on a rope as a weapon.  She defeats them and gets some information
- The pirates belong the crew of a man called "Villiers" who is a pirate from Tortuga who has rejected [[Sharkbait]]'s Kingship
- They were smuggled into Petit-Goave aboard [[La Madre de Dios]] in preparation for this attack.
- [[Sybil]] fights her way into the Governor's manor carrying one of the wounded pirates with her so that he can finger the culprit (Cardoza).
- They find the Governor and his family trapped in the 3rd floor tower of the manor surrounded by pirates, who are unable to advance because the stairwell is covered by the remaining guards.
- The pirates elect to burn the house and tower with the Governor inside if he refuses to come out.  At the last moment, Jean-Paul shoots the molotov the pirate had lit, detonating it and doing greivous harm to the remaining pirates.
- The Governor is told about the attack and who is behind it.
- [[Sybil]] volunteers to head back out to help the garrison forces reach the manor.
- On her way to the harbor to aid the soldiers, she is engaged by [[Juan Cardoza]], who is overseeing the invasion and sees an opportunity to blame [[Sybil]] for this mess.
- They fight, both wounding each other, before the soldiers arrive on the scene.  Cardoza claims that Sybil is a pirate who attacked him, and presents papers marking him as a dipomat of the Spanish Crown.
- The soldiers take them both into custody and deliver them to the Governor to sort out.  They don't take away Juan's weapons, but do have Sybil's.
