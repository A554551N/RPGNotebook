**Location:** Where it takes place
*In Which the Enemy brings pressure to bear on an unwilling colonial governor, offering inducements, and violence should that inducement fail . . .*

- [[Sybil]] is delivered to Nassau by El Mapache after the Letters Debacle so that she can search for Jean-Paul (the Frenchman from the Guadalupe Affair)
- To find him, she leverages her pirate contacts in Nassau (primarily an old one-armed pirate named Remondo who runs the Pirate's Arm(s))
	- He tells her that Jean-Paul is a "guest" of Captain Felton, a small-time pirate with big ambitions.  He's captured Jean-Paul and is holding him ransom.
	- He points her to the "Crimson Cow", a pirate watering hole in the cellar of a burnt-out old house, he says that Felton's boys drink there.
- The bartender at the Cow points her to Felton's boys.
