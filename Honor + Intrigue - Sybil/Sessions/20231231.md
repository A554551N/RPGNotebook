**Location:** Where it takes place
*In Which the Enemy brings pressure to bear on an unwilling colonial governor, offering inducements, and violence should that inducement fail . . .*

- [[Sybil]] is delivered to Nassau by El Mapache after the Letters Debacle so that she can search for Jean-Paul (the Frenchman from the Guadalupe Affair)
- To find him, she leverages her pirate contacts in Nassau (primarily an old one-armed pirate named Remondo who runs the Pirate's Arm(s))
	- He tells her that Jean-Paul is a "guest" of Captain Felton, a small-time pirate with big ambitions.  He's captured Jean-Paul and is holding him ransom.
	- He points her to the "Crimson Cow", a pirate watering hole in the cellar of a burnt-out old house, he says that Felton's boys drink there.
- The bartender at the Cow points her to Felton's boys.
- Felton's crew sends [[Sybil]] to Felton's Cove outside of town, where she finds Jean-Paul dressed up like a man-baby and being made to scrape barnacles off the side of a careened ship.
- Felton has a friendly conversation with [[Sybil]], all the while plying her with large amounts of drinks.  He finds her equal to the amount of liquor he's put in her, and isn't able to get her drunk enough to attempt to kidnap.
- His ambition frustrated, he finally lets her talk to Jean-Paul.
	- Jean-Paul doesn't care about the fate of the pirates or of the French holdings, but readily agrees to help if she will help him escape.
	- She pays the rest of her money to Felton to free Jean-Paul, who will write letters to anyone she asks.
	- He suggests that any attack on Tortuga would have to deal with the naval station at Petit-Goave in Santo Domingo.
- [[Sybil]] charters a ship from Nassau
