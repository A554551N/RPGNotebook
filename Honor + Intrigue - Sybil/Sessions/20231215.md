# 20231215 Session Notes
**Location:** Nassau (Pirate Haven)
*[[Sybil]] spends off her ill-gotten gains from the [[20231209|Guadelupe Deception]], living the high-life in the pirate stronghold of Nassau.  Some of the proceeds were put toward tracking down [[Juan Cardoza]], and it is the fruit of that expenditure that forms the fruit of this story.*
- An agent of the mysterious broker [[Sybil]] hired to track Cardoza's movements across the Caribbean makes contact in Nassau
	- He slips in through the window dressed like an Assassin
	- He tells her that Cardoza has retreated to the Spanish stronghold at Maracaibo for repairs to La Madre
	- He has spent the intervening time writing a large quantity of letters, but the spy couldn't get close enough to read the contents and chose not to risk intercepting the courier 
	- The Agent has also been assigned to keep an eye on [[El Mapache]], and tells [[Sybil]] that the adventurer was last seen attacking a slave ship and freeing the captives aboard.
	- [[Sybil]] considers it likely that at least some of the letters being written by Cardoza are bound for Spain, and resolves to capture the ship carrying the mail before it leaves the Caribbean.
	- The Agent is assigned to determine what ship will be leaving Havana with the mail on-board.  In the meantime, [[Sybil]] signs on with the pirate crew of [[Smiling Jaq]] MacGregor, a Scot pirate who *hates* the English.
- Jaq has a lead on a heavily loaded merchant convoy carrying sugar north to New England and has a plan to take it.  In possession of a stolen British Navy Frigate, complete with flags and uniforms, she intends to infiltrate the convoy disguised as part of the naval escort and attack the merchantman by surprise.
- Arriving on the scene, they find a fleet of four merchantman ships escorted by three British Naval Corvettes.  The plan goes off without a hitch and the pirates are able to get very close to one of the merchantmen.
- [[Sybil]], along with a few other crewmen and Jaq's First Mate Mr. Mulligan, leaps aboard the vessel and begins fighting to take control of it.
	- As the fighting commences, British Marines pour out from below decks.  It's a trap!  [[Sybiil]] single-handedly fights off 10 of the King's finest, taking a couple cuts in return in the process.
	- The last marine, a young-ish kid named Isaac, initially refuses to surrender and deals [[Sybil]] a nasty cut, but [[Sybil]] disarms him and he quickly sees the error of his ways.
	- The remaining crewmen of the Merchant surrender
- [[Smiling Jaq]] fires on the naval Corvettes and succeeds at drawing two of them away, the third gives chase!
	- Fair winds and a lucky sandbar helps the crew of the stolen merchant escape the Corvette, but not before taking a few cannon shots from the navy ship's chasers.
	- The crew of the Merchantman, press-ganged into assisting with the escape, is released onto a rowboat once the danger is passed, but a few choose to stay on with Jaq's crew.
	- Isaac the Marine stays with [[Sybil]]
- [[Smiling Jaq]] successfully evades the enemy Corvettes, though at some cost to her ship and crew.  She meets [[Sybil]] and the Merchantman at an established rendezvous to meet with a merchant Agent she calls "Drake" who buys stolen goods from pirates and resells them to unscrupulous merchants at a discount.  
- He takes the load of sugar and pays Jaq, who duly pays [[Sybil]], and they deposit her in **San Juan**, where she can hop a merchant freighter to **Havana**, to attempt to intercept the packet ship before it reaches the open sea.
