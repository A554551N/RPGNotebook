# 20231209 Session Notes

- [[Sybil]] is in Guadalupe after being dropped off by [[El Mapache]] and her money is getting low.  She is approached by a mysterious Frenchman who calls himself "Jean-Paul".
- "Jean-Paul" gets her in on a plan to infiltrate a pit fighting ring and beat their best fighter (who is planning to take a dive), then to collect a big purse and escape.
- The fighter, Henri, is trapped in his current arrangement by criminals who have threatened to do him harm if he tries to leave.
- Jean-Paul tells them that he has arranged the ship *Le Fauchon* to carry them into English water (to a village on Nevis) the day after the con goes down.
	- [[Sybil]] notes that it seems odd to stay in town for a night after angering the criminals.  Jean-Paul insists that his friend on *Le Fauchon* is the fastest way off the island.
	- She is suspicious of Jean-Paul's motives, but continues with the plan.  She takes some precautions to make sure she can escape if it all goes wrong.
- At the fights, the lady who runs them (Monica) shows [[Sybil]] that the Governor himself is in attendance.  He's a bit of a hound for gambling and likes to bet on the fights.  She realizes that this is the point of what John-Paul has planned, to fleece the governor out of his cash.
