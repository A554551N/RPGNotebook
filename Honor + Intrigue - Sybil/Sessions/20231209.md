# 20231209 Session Notes

- [[Sybil]] is in Guadalupe after being dropped off by [[El Mapache]] and her money is getting low.  She is approached by a mysterious Frenchman who calls himself "[[Jean-Paul]]".
- "[[Jean-Paul]]" gets her in on a plan to infiltrate a pit fighting ring and beat their best fighter (who is planning to take a dive), then to collect a big purse and escape.
- The fighter, Henri, is trapped in his current arrangement by criminals who have threatened to do him harm if he tries to leave.
- [[Jean-Paul]] tells them that he has arranged the ship *Le Fauchon* to carry them into English water (to a village on Nevis) the day after the con goes down.
	- [[Sybil]] notes that it seems odd to stay in town for a night after angering the criminals.  [[Jean-Paul]] insists that his friend on *Le Fauchon* is the fastest way off the island.
	- She is suspicious of [[Jean-Paul]]'s motives, but continues with the plan.  She takes some precautions to make sure she can escape if it all goes wrong.
- At the fights, the lady who runs them (Monica) shows [[Sybil]] that the Governor himself is in attendance.  He's a bit of a hound for gambling and likes to bet on the fights.  She realizes that this is the point of what John-Paul has planned, to fleece the governor out of his cash.
- [[Sybil]] wins the fight when Henri cedes advantage, costing the governor a mountain of cash.
- The governor sends his thugs after Henri to find out what happened, she discovers this when she visits Henri's room and sees that it's been cleaned out.
	- [[Sybil]] uses her feminine wiles to get someone in the bar to tell her where Henri had gone.  The lead sends her to the "Dancing Dauphin Winehouse" near the docks.  She arrives just in time to see [[Jean-Paul]] dispatch one of a half-dozen assailants with a gun.
	- He asks her if she's seen Henri (she hasn't).  More thugs are arriving.
- There is a brief scuffle between them, ending inconclusively.  With the additional enemies incoming, they decide to join forces to escape.  [[Jean-Paul]] sets off a small bomb in the narrow staircase before they escape out the window and leap onto the deck of *Le Fauchon* to escape.
- [[Sybil]] gets [[Jean-Paul]] to turn over her share of the loot, and they disappear into the night air, leaving Henri behind to pay for their crime.
