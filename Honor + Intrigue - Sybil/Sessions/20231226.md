# 20231226 Session Notes
**Location:** The Spanish Stronghold of Havana
*Sybil arrives in Havana as a sailor aboard a reputable Spanish merchant ship.  She is seeking the Royal Mail with an eye toward grabbing it before it is loaded in with the  rest of the treasure and delivered to Spain.*
- [[Sybil]] arrives in Havana and sees the Treasure Fleet already being loaded for the return trip to Spain, by her estimate she has less than three days to recover the letters before they're safely aboard and on its way to Spain
- She takes a bed at **El Hombre Grande**, a shitty dockside tavern
- After this, she stakes out the warehouse and sees it protected by around a dozen patrolling guards and officers.  The warehouse is a hotbed of activity as laborers load the last boats bound for the treasure fleet.  She decides to hire some high-class whores to distract the guards (leaving her **low on funds**).
> She scores a **MIghty Success** and chooses to hang on to the extra benefit provided by the whores
- In the warehouse, she spots a man bedecked in pistols watching the loading process.  This is *[[The Cannon|The Cannon (El CaÃ±on)]]*, the Pirate Hunter.
- [[Sybil]] inserts herself into the process by pretending to be a laborer and moving some of the mail.  She is eventually reassigned to a different job, but she doesn't know what they are asking her to do (her Spanish is not great).  She grabs the wrong thing and draws attention to herself.
- She decides to leg it rather than try to talk her way out.  [[The Cannon]] spots her as she moves and fires, nearly killing her.  She escapes from the room in the uproar (consuming her free advantage to ensure the guards are still 'tied up').
- Once she is away, The Cannon orders his Hounds to check the dockside inns for new arrivals that may have been shot.
- During the day, [[Sybil]] attempts to sweet-talk the guards at the warehouse to get more information, she gets some things but nothing too valuable.
> Lysa spends an FP to have [[El Mapache]] appear to help out.  He's introduced here fighting with some of [[The Cannon]]'s Hounds outside El Hombre Grande
- [[El Mapache]] is willing to assist in the plan to retrieve Cardoza's letters, if [[Sybil]] helps him to lighten the Treasure Fleet's load so that he can return some of the gold to the natives.
- The next morning, after the plan is settled, [[Sybil]] and [[El Mapache]] get their men into the warehouse bearing the seal of [[Agustin Abarquero|Admiral Abarquero]] under the guise of demanding more men to complete the loading of the Treasure Fleet early.
- To ensure that Mapache's men aren't detected or hurt during the fighting, [[Sybil]] lures [[The Cannon]] away by making targeted appearances not far from the warehouse.  He takes the bait and leaves the warehouse unattended except for a handful of guards.  These guards are handily defeated and [[Sybil]] gets the letters she's after.
	- The letter describes [[Juan Cardoza|Juan]] and [[Isadora Abarquero-Cardoza|Isadora]]'s plan to capture Tortuga from the French to remove the pirate threat and to put the island in the hands of a "capable Spanish governor such as [[Agustin Abarquero]]"
- After several wagonloads of gold are put together, the gang goes to leave only for one of Mapache's nameless crewmen to catch a bullet when the door opens.  It seems [[The Cannon]] is onto them!
