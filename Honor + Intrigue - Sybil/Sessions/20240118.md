# 20240118 Session Notes
**Location:** Maracaibo
*In Which Sharkbait and Sybil rob the Inquisition of a Map to Fabulous Wealth*

- [[Sybil]] and [[Sharkbait]] depart from Tortuga in search of a great Prize to show the pirates of Tortuga that [[Sharkbait]] is still a good pirate and leader.
- He tells [[Sybil]] that he has heard of cities lost to the jungle (like El Dorado), and that the Inquisitor of Maracaibo supposedly keeps maps to all the ones the Spaniards know about.
	- [[Sharkbait]] adds that a contact of his has given him a way into the Inquisition's fortress, a tiny sewer pipe that will bring [[Sybil]] inside the fortress.
- They arrive in Maracaibo, [[Sharkbait]] talks a little about his background (he gives the name Carlos Espinoza, Esq. to the shipping officers) and carries Spanish travel papers.
	- Once upon a time Sharkbait was a fence dealing in stolen goods here in Maracaibo.
- They case the joint, [[Sybil]] asks for a disguise in order to stealth into the place
## The Fortress
> [!warning] Alertness Clock
> The Fortress is governed by a four section Alertness Clock.  It is filled by failed rolls and "loud" actions.
> **1/4 Sections**
- [[Sybil]] decides to pretend to be a monk for as long as possible and spends her first day in the cloisters writing copies of signs.
- The door to the Scriptorium is locked with two locks (-2 difficulty each).  The keys are carried by Brother Lysander, the Head of the Scriptorium, and Brother Ignatius, the Inquisitor in command of the fortress.
- During dinner, the monk next to her seems surprised that she's 'out of the infirmary'
- She discovers that almost everyone in the fortress comes together for Morning and Evening prayer (for an hour) giving her a window to work.
- At the end of the day, she arranges a signal with the pirates outside to detonate a keg of gunpowder under the wall of the castle.  When this occurs, [[Sybil]] is inside of a privy and is covered in the spray of sewer water again.
- She convinces the Circuitor to go and get her some clean robes (she doesn't want to track filth around the place with the Inspector about.)
- While the Circuitor is away, she sneaks over to the door to the Scriptorium and picks both locks.
	- Inside she finds a work table covered in maps and diagrams describing the various ruins and cities they found in the Yucatan.
	- She steals the necessary documents
	- Before she can leave, the Head Inquisitor arrives with their guest.  [[Sybil]] is nearly caught but manages to avoid them and slip out.  Before she escapes she runs into the Circuitor who raises the alarm.  She dodges passed him and back down the latrine.
	- Outside of the fortress, she's picked up and rowed back to [[Sharkbait]]'s ship as the fortress comes alive since the alarm is raised.
