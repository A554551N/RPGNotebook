# 20231227 Session Notes
**Location:** The Spanish Stronghold of Havana
*[[Sybil]] has discovered [[Juan Cardoza]]'s plan to invade Tortuga with an army of pirate hunters to deny her safe haven there.  She makes ready to flee with [[El Mapache]]'s crew in tow when the feared pirate hunter [[The Cannon|El CaÃ±on]] catches up with her in the warehouses outside the Treasure Fleet's staging warehouse.*

- [[Sybil]] pushes a barrel of gunpowder out of the warehouse into the oncoming band of Hounds.  The barrel explodes, killing a number of them and shocking the rest.  The crew immediately rushes out hauling the wagon across the exposed square and using it for cover.
- It's slow going because the wagon is very heavy.
