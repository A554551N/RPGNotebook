*El Santo* is a Spanish Naval brig liberated from the fleet and used by [[El Mapache]] to seek adventure along the Spanish Main.  She most recently saw action against **Juan Cardoza's** ***Madre de Dios*** during the Affair of Isle de Castille.  Mapache is not a sailor, and the ship is actually commanded by [[Misc NPCs#^0263ee|Hamish Brown]], an ornery Englishman with a drinking problem
