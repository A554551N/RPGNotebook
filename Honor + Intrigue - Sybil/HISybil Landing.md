# Honor + Intrigue: Stolen Hearts
**Danger on the High Seas!**
*The beautiful pirate stands firm atop the blazing remains of the Spanish Warship.  'You shan't get away with this Cardoza, your scheme ends here!'
The rapier-wielding Spaniard opposite grits his teeth in a wolf's smile, gleaming in the firelight.  'You cannot defeat me wench!  The island will fall before the day breaks!*
*As their blades clash, freedom battles tyranny in a last-ditch effort to save the home of the pirates.*
> Pursued by enemies from her youth, the pirate Sybil finds herself trapped in the middle of a vast conspiracy to destroy the pirate haven of Tortuga.
