# Sharkbait, The Pirate King
**Nationality:** Unknown

Sharkbait is the self-proclaimed "Pirate King" of Tortuga.  He doesn't seem to engage in much actual piracy, instead wiling away his days drinking and whoring.  He has an on-again off-again relationship with [[Sybil]], and also with a younger woman Sybil calls his "roommate-wife" due to the unusual nature of their relationship (he's taking care of her for a friend who had died, but is also sleeping with her)
