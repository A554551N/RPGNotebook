# Agustin Abarquero, Admiral of the Armada
**Nationality:** Spain

Agustin Abarquero, via a pseudonym, engaged in an affair with [[Sybil]] prior to the start of the campaign.  The end of this affair prompted [[Sybil]] to flee mainland Europe for the Caribbean.

His wife [[Isadora Abarquero-Cardoza|Isadora]] discovered the details of the affair and pinned blame for it on [[Sybil]].  Since then, she has focused her family's considerable influence on catching the young pirate and punishing her for her perceived wrong.

It's largely unknown how Agustin feels about his wife's vendetta, or whether he even knows about it.
