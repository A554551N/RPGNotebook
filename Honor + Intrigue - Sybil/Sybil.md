# Sybil

Sybil is **English**, but well-traveled.  While young, she was a **Scoundrel** and a **Charlatan** before leaving **England** to train in Italian Style fencing and then onto Spain where she met [[Agustin Abarquero]] while she was working as a whore.  They carried on an extensive affair, which ended when Agustinâ€™s wife became aware of the situation.  Perhaps unfairly, [[Isadora Abarquero-Cardoza]] appears to blame Sybil for her husband straying.  The woman developed a vendetta against Sybil, which caused Sybil to flee the Old World for the relative safety of the Caribbean.  Most recently, she has turned her blade to piracy (which she has a surprising knack for).  She has become a confidante of the [[Sharkbait|Pirate King of Tortuga]] and is recognized by most of the Brethren of the Coast as a trustworthy and competent companion.
