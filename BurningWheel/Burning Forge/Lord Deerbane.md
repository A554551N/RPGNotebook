- He's regarded as a fairly brutal lord, and no one in [Bremendeschmiede](Bremendeschmiede.md) seems to much care for him.
- After his victory over [Lord Tillman](Lord%20Tillman.md), he declared all of Tillman's soldiers to be guilty of treason for taking up arms against him.
- Deerbane rules from the castle at Hirschhohl
