#burningwheel #torsten 
*A Knight of Lord Deerbane, a hardened veteran.*

- [Lord Deerbane](Lord%20Deerbane.md)'s brother and enforcer.
- Sven is badly maimed around his face, which gives him a bit of a nightmarish appearance
- Everyone in the village fears him, though he hasn't done anything to earn such fear so far.
- He has good quality arms and armor and rides a warhorse.  Torsten doesn't want to fight him.
