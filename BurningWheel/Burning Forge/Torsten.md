# Torsten, the Bear of Bremendeshmiede
#burningwheel #torsten

## BITs
### Beliefs
- [Lord Deerbane](Lord%20Deerbane.md)'s Thugs have taken over the village, but that isn't my problem anymore... **REWRITE THE END OF THIS ONE**
- [Seppel](../Seppel.md)'s would-be rebels are going to get themselves killed.  I'll teach them to use their arms so that they might at least have a chance.
- I have been party to enough bloodshed to last 10 lifetimes.  Never again will I raise a weapon in anger against my fellow man.

### Instincts
- Always hide my face when the authorities are present.
- Never say more than I absolutely must.
- Never allow someone weaker to bear a difficult burden.

## Notes
* Torsten's father was named Eilert
