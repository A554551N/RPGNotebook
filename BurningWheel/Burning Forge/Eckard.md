# Eckard, Guard Captain

*Watch Captain of the Village Guard*

- Watch Captain in [Bremendeschmiede](Bremendeschmiede.md)
- [Torsten](Torsten.md) made a friend of Eckard with a gift of a custom spear fit to the man's body.
- He's younger than Torsten, as are most of the village guard.
- While the man is a [Deerbane](Lord%20Deerbane.md) loyalist, he seems decent enough.
- He doesn't like having [Sven Wolfkiller](Sven%20Wolfkiller.md) in town, because they have to drill a ton.
