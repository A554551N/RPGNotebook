## Torsten, the Bear of Bremendeshmiede
### Beliefs
- [Lord Deerbane](Lord%20Deerbane.md)'s Thugs have taken over the village, but that isn't my problem anymore.  I will figure out what it will take to get Sven to leave the village so that things will calm down.
- [Seppel](../Seppel.md) has spoken of a nascent rebel movement in town.  I will convince them of the folly of fighting against Sven and the soldiers.
- I have been party to enough bloodshed to last 10 lifetimes.  Never again will I raise a weapon in anger against my fellow man.
### Instincts
- Always hide my face when the authorities are present.
- Never say more than I absolutely must.
- Never allow someone weaker to bear a difficult burden.

## Session
- During a conversation at the forge, Torsten begins learning Ugly Truth by showing Sven the danger of using a battered sword so that he will ask for a new one.
	- Once asked, Torsten promises a new sword to Sven.
- [[Sina]] is making plans to travel to Hirschhohl, [Lord Deerbane](../Lord%20Deerbane.md)'s castle town, to get cloth for her shop.  Torsten asks her to also collect plans for a sword from the Guild Smith in Hirschhohl.
	- Torsten failed the Circles test for the Guild Blacksmith in Hirschhohl.
- Seppel wants Torsten to teach the rebels how to fight.  Torsten wants nothing to do with it because their plan is suicide.
	- They engage in **Duel of Wits**.

### Seppel & Torsten Duel of Wits
>**Torsten Statement of Purpose:** "[Lord Tillman](../Lord%20Tillman.md) doesn't give a shit about you and you're throwing your life away fighting for them."
>**Seppel Statement of Purpose:** "Torsten has lost his loyalty to Tillman. He must aid us with training and arms if we're to succeed in ousting Deerbane from our home."

The Duel ends in a single exchange, Seppel reveals surprising persuasive skill and wins without compromise.  Torsten agrees (begrudgingly) to provide training and arms to the rebels.

* Having been so beaten, Torsten joins Seppel on a walk into the moors beyond the village where the rest of the rebels are training.  They're a motley bunch, some of whom are carrying weapons they have no knowledge of how to use.
* Torsten suggests the group begin with the spear, a good weapon for the average peasant soldier.  One of the rebels, a woman named **Adda**, protests and demands to be trained with her deceased husband's warhammer.
	* Torsten, seeking to make a point, tests Brawling and takes the hammer out of her hands.  Point proven, the villagers agree to begin with the spear.
* Torsten performs the first Instruction test (Torsten is BLing Instruction) and fails.  The next Instruction test is at +1 Ob.
