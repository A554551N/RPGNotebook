## Torsten, the Bear of Bremendeshmiede
### Beliefs
- [Lord Deerbane](Lord%20Deerbane.md)'s Thugs have taken over the village, but that isn't my problem anymore.  I will supply them with forge goods to keep their suspicions at bay, and convince the Lord's agent to sponsor my forge so that I can continue to work.
- A good blacksmith is too valuable to give up lightly, I will make something of value for everyone in the village so that they will not turn me over to the soldiers.
- I have been party to enough bloodshed to last 10 lifetimes.  Never again will I raise a weapon in anger against my fellow man.

### Instincts
- Always hide my face when the authorities are present.
- Never say more than I absolutely must.
- Never allow someone weaker to bear a difficult burden.

## Session
- [Torsten](../Torsten.md) canvasses the village, taking stock of what people need done.  He keeps a special eye out for staunch [Deerbane](../Lord%20Deerbane.md) loyalists.  Since they're most likely to turn him in, he resolves to take extra care with their goods to earn their loyalty.
- The Butcher tells Torsten that [Lord Tillman](../Lord%20Tillman.md) is rumored to bbe scheduled for hanging.  This surprises Torsten as it would be quite unusual for one noble to hang another.
	- Torsten decides to carefully ask around to see if there's truth to the rumors.  He's not sure yet what he will do if the rumors are true.
- [Sina](../Sina.md) needs needles.  Torsten isn't sure how to make them, but he'll try as way of apology for his long absence.
	- Based on the results of a later **Blacksmithing** Test (Ob 5 for Complex Tools), Torsten definitely doesn't know how to make needles.
	- Torsten is also practicing Carving in the evening, to try to make a set out of bone.
- Torsten asks [Eckard](../Eckard.md) at the guard house if there's any truth to the rumors about the hanging.  Eckard assures him that the rumor is false and that the same rumor has been being spread for a while in town.
- At the end of the day, Torsten tests **Falsehood** to see how well he disguised his remaining loyalty to Tillman while dealing with the Deerbane loyalists.  He failed, and so left an unfortunate impression behind.
- [Sven Wolfkiller](../Sven%20Wolfkiller.md), a Knight and Agent of Lord Deerbane, visited the forge to discuss a sponsorship arrangement to get the forge up and running.
	- He agreees to supply the forge with raw materials if Torsten will make spears & arrowheads for Deerbane's forces along with the village goods.  Torsten agrees, even if he privately dislikes the idea of hopping into bed with Deerbane.
- Promise of ore in hand, Torsten tests **Circles** to locate a village kid who would be willing to work in the forge for experience and a little coin.
	- The test is successful, and reveals that [Seppel](../Seppel.md)'s son Meinerd is a bit of a layabout who gets into trouble with the guard.  Torsten offers to teach Meinerd a bit of the Smith's trade, so that the boy has something else to do besides cause trouble.
- During the discussion of apprenticing his son, [Seppel](../Seppel.md) appeared very nervous.  He nearly fled the house when Torsten knocked at the door.
	- Torsten pushes him a little on this, and finds that Seppel readily admits to associating with a small group of people who are angry that Deerbane has taken over the village and plan to do something about it.
	- He is delivering deliberately shoddy work to the Lord when he is called upon to do Carpentry.
	- Seppel wants Torsten to come out to the woods and teach the assembled villagers how to fight against Deerbane.
		- Torsten wants the opposite, for the people to settle down and not get themselves killed.  This is likely to end up as a Duel of Wits at some point.
	- To ease Seppel's mind, Torsten tells him that if he is ever in danger that he should come to the forge and Torsten would help him.
- Session closed with a montage of blacksmithing work (about 5 weeks) as Torsten begins filling the Deerbane and the Village's orders.
	- Torsten doesn't produce enough arrowheads and spearheads to satisfy Sven, so the Knight will stick around longer than expected.
	- Torsten makes mistakes with Amalric the Farmer's horse shoes and plow.  This is a problem because Amalric is the most outspoken Deerbane loyalist in the village.
	- Produces high quality meat hooks for the butcher, a Deerbane loyalist.  He is friendly, and Torsten doesn't think he needs to worry about him.
	- Attempted to make needles for Sina, but such delicate work is beyond the skill of his craft.
	- Fixed a number of mugs for Uncle Wilhelm at the local tavern.
