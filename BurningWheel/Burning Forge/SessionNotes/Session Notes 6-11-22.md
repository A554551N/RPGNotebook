#sessionNotes #burningwheel #torsten
*6-11-22*

- [[../Bremendeschmiede]] - My Village
- [[Torsten]] entered under the cover of night like a thief to reclaim his father's home.
- Meets his niece who has come to see who is occupying the old forge.
- His village has been taken over by [[Lord Deerbane]], after capturing [[Lord Tillman]] in battle, breaking his army, and making it an act of treason to be affiliated with [Lord Tillman](Lord%20Tillman.md)'s army.
* [Torsten](Torsten.md) is called "The Bear" due to his grumbling demeanor and tremendous size.
- On his first day in the forge, he makes spearheads for the guard and nails for his house.  The spears so the guards will leave him be, and the nails because the roof leaks.
* [[Sina]] is still angry that he left all of those years ago, she feels bitter because all the men in her life abandon her.
	- Father (Rudolph) was killed by soldiers, but [Torsten](Torsten.md) doesn't know this yet.
	- Her husband Tod ran off on her and their daughter, [Torsten](Torsten.md) met Tod in [[Koenigstul]] but didn't know that they were married.
	- Despite her anger, she offers to cook dinner for [Torsten](Torsten.md) so that he doesn't go hungry.  He accepts, and gets wrangled into cooking dinner next time.  In order for that to happen, he needs to fix up the old cottage first.
- Passes BL Weaponsmith to adjust the new spears to the guards.  They're thrilled to have working weapons.
- Will, one of the guards, is sullen and rude to [Torsten](Torsten.md).  He takes it in stride rather than cause a scene.
- Circles Test to find a carpenter to fix up the forge + cottage
	- Success, a childhood friend named Seppel who was the Carpenter's son when [Torsten](Torsten.md) left home.
- Low on supplies, [Torsten](Torsten.md) leverages his success with the spears. [Torsten](Torsten.md) asks Eckard (the leader of the guards he helped) if [Lord Deerbane](Lord%20Deerbane.md) would be willing to sponsor the forge with metal and coal in exchange for forged goods.
	- While it galls [Torsten](Torsten.md) to aid Deerbane, he is doing his best to put the war behind him, and sees this as the best way to get supplies for the forge so that he can focus on work.
	- Eckard says that the Lord's representative will be in town shortly, and that he would be the right person to ask.  [Torsten](Torsten.md) is apprehensive about approaching the authorities, but hopes that the passage of time has served to make him less recognizable.
- As the session ended, an armor clad figure entered the village bearing the mark of a wolf whose skull is split with a sword.  [Torsten](Torsten.md) recognizes the mark as belonging to a commander of [Lord Deerbane](Lord%20Deerbane.md)'s forces who was at the battle where [Lord Tillman](Lord%20Tillman.md) was captured.
