## Torsten, the Bear of Bremendeshmiede
### Beliefs
- [Lord Deerbane](Lord%20Deerbane.md)'s Thugs have taken over the village, but that isn't my problem anymore.  I will forge a fine blade for Sven so that he will leave the village.
- [Seppel](../Seppel.md)'s would-be rebels are going to get themselves killed.  I'll teach them to use their arms so that they might at least have a chance.
- I have been party to enough bloodshed to last 10 lifetimes.  Never again will I raise a weapon in anger against my fellow man.
### Instincts
- Always hide my face when the authorities are present.
- Never say more than I absolutely must.
- Never allow someone weaker to bear a difficult burden.

## Session
*Tonight's session was a little on the slow side, but I enjoyed the chance to get to know some of the characters (mostly Torsten's niece Freida)*
* Succeeded at an Ob 4 Blacksmithing Test to forge the sword for Sven, with an extra success allocated to quality.
* The rebels begin bringing Torsten weapons and raw materials for weapons concealed in baskets of food.  Alarmed that he may be detected, he demands Seppel help dig a hiding place under the coal bin in the forge to keep the illegal arms from being spotted.
	* We succeeded on this test with a couple extra successes allocated to quality (we made it easy to open and close, and stored it under the coal bin which is too heavy for most folks to move).
* Sina returned to town from her trip to Hirschhohl, and gives Torsten some new shirts she made out of a light and (mostly) fireproof material.  They're dyed and of obvious quality.
	* Without thinking about it, Torsten dons a shirt in [Lord Tillman](../Lord%20Tillman.md)'s colors, as they're what he's used to wearing.
* Torsten brings the sword to Sven who announces it to be satisfactory, he also hears that Sven is planning to leave town tomorrow.
* Torsten has a chance to bond with his niece Freida, she's very excited about her new toy horse and has a lot to say about it.  He 'shoes' the horse with a couple of small nails, which she is thrilled with.
* Sina has invited someone new to our weekly family meal.  Unsure who to expect, Torsten opens the door and finds Sven there.  This should be good. . .
