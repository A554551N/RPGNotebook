# 20240116 Session Notes
- We spent most of this session talking over Beliefs and getting ready to play agian.
- [[Bumper]] and [[Kornelie]] approach [[Parsley]] to see about joining up with the Crusade.  [[Parsley]] offers them a spot if [[Bumper]] rejoins the church.  [[Bumper]] attempts to do it, but [[Parsley]] sees the falseness of his profession of faith and rescinds the offer.
- The [[Custodian]] returns from scouting the area around [[Mrak'n A'plana]], and reveals to [[Bumper]] that there is a large Roden nest beneath the mountain, and that intelligent, sentient Twisted have taken up residence in the dwarven halls.
- To protect the [[Custodian]] from the blazing sun, the group decides to travel at night, leaving immediately.
