*The Eastern Hold*
- The dwarves of [[Din'Geletokir]] think that the dwarves from Kamazamka are strange.
- [[Kornelie]] is from here.
- Like most dwarves, the dwarves of Kamazamka dislike outsiders and outcasts.
- The hold is ruled by House Magomedov, currently headed by prince [[Timir Bulat Magomedov]]
- The forest has been cut back for miles around the mountain, both to improve defensive visibility and to make room for all of the fields that support the mountain.
