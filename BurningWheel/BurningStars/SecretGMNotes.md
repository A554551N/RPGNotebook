# GM Notes
## The Nightweaver's Change
**Status:** Meandering thought
I think the Weaver changed, but no one knows this (I think she becomes a patron of Dark Elves.  Did they cause her change?)

## [[Kamazamka]] and [[Mrak'n A'plana]]
- There are rumors that someone has found a way into the tunnels beneath [[Mrak'n A'plana]]
	- The Dwarf in question is [[Umar Barsukov]], the descendant of one of the royal Houses of [[Mrak'n A'plana]].  He hopes to use the knowledge to lead forces into the ancient hold.
- Within the mountain, there are Roden, Orcs, Trolls, and worse things in the deep tunnels.
- The Orcs are remnant Elves who seek to breach the mountain and bring the world above to heel, having been driven mad by the [[Shadow Weaver]]'s songs.
