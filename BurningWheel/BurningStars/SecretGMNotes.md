# GM Notes
## The Nightweaver's Change
**Status:** Solid
I think the Weaver changed, but no one knows this (I think she becomes a patron of Dark Elves.  Did they cause her change?)
- I believe that the Weaver has not truly changed, but instead that the death of the Gods of the Overworld has made room for Gods of the Underworld (such as Aecer) to emerge.  The Weaver's constellation was chosen because this New God is the 'Dark Sister' of the Weaver (I mean it's fucking Llolth obvs, who has been imprisoned beneath the earth for practically ever)

## What the Custodian Wants
- We've established that the Custodian wants to return to Envakadi, but can't because he was banished after killing another Elf (I don't have all the details worked out here, but the Kinslayer trait seems valid).
	-  I have decided that this is a lie, the only one that he has ever told in Morwen's presence.  He tells this lie to make Morwen feel more comfortable traveling with him.
- I feel like he wants to go home to try to reach the object of his desire (the Etharch's Daughter), but I also wonder if there's more to it than that.
	- There is.  Whatever has created the constellation has a source, and the Custodian is compelled to seek it.  He believes that the Sanctum of Stars (the most sacred place in Elvendom) is where such a power would manifest.
- Of the monsters we've talked about, the Custodian is surprisingly sane.
- He clearly has a connection to [[Morwen]], but I'm not exactly sure what yet.  The straightforward answer is that he's interested in her from a purely psychological perspective.  She is the first Elf he's seen in hundreds of years after all.  I feel like his monstrous side is compelling him to try and crush her spirit and raise her grief.  After all, misery loves company.
	- I know the answer to this now!  He recognized her immediately as a descendant of the Maid from **The Lament of Galuchanar** and intends to use her to bypass him (as he's using the villagers to bypass the guards)

## Uncategorized
- I have a scene on my head where the party enters an ancient throne room in Envakadi, probably at the top of a tower much like the one they found in Sibiu.  The throne is empty, the Custodian moves to sit upon it.
	- With the new thoughts, I think that he sits on the throne and then a hulking spider-shadow descends from the ceiling and settles down behind it.
- I have a scene in my head (the next time I need a major fucking plot twist) that one of the old gods in the pit around Envakadi awakens and emerges to wage war against the New God, which puts Envakadi in danger.  **Who is this God?**
