*The City at the Center of the World*

- [[Galuchanar]] rules Envakadi after returning from his exile.
- The [[Custodian]] was born in & exiled from here.
- The city rests on a pillar of stone in the center of a great crater.  In happier times, the waterfalls from the city poured off of the cliffs and filled the bowl with a peaceful mist.
- The ruined city is filled with monstrous Starspawn, while the Citadel is held by the Dark Elves
- The depths of the pillar are filled with Memorium Chambers, where the soul gems of deceased elves are taken.
- At the bottom of the pit are pitiful creatures, not as powerful as the Starspawn in the city.  They subsist on the remaining energy from the Corpse of the God that fills the bottom level.
