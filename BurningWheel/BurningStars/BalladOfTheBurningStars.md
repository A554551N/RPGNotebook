## Situation
A hundred years ago, or so the legend goes, on the Night of the Burning Stars the Gods of Men & Elves came forth from the vaults of the heavens to make war upon each other in our world.  The armies of Men joined in battle in support of their various deities and the world was laid to waste by their warring.

In the absence of the Gods, the natural order has begun to unravel.  The wheel of seasons no longer turns, the magic of the earth has gone awry, and a wicked corruption spreads across the lands.  Prayers go unanswered, the sky is empty of stars.

The Dwarves beneath the earth were spared the worst of the war, and have emerged more powerful than ever.  Their ancient Deep Roads permit trade to continue beneath the blasted surface, and their weapons and armor equip the raiders and caravans that dare the wastelands.

The Elves of Envakadi were a different story entirely.  Deeply entwined with the natural magics of the Earth, the upheaval caused by the Gods’ arrival destroyed their sacred city and caused many to succumb to Grief, and yet more to Spite.  Those that haven’t fled the waking world for the West have hidden themselves away in the hidden places of the world, and it wasn’t clear how long they would remain in the world.

From hidden warrens beneath the rolling plains, the Roden have emerged to join this new world.  Bearing the message of a new God and new Science from their subterranean home.  It’s not certain how these newcomers will fit into the world.

Finally, on the hundredth anniversary of the Night of Burning Stars, a single new constellation dominates the twilight sky.  What does this mean?  Does a new God reign supreme in the heavens?

## Characters

### Morwen
#### Beliefs
- It's been a hundred years since the stars shone in the sky, I will learn this new one and what brought it about.
- I will collect every story of the fall of the Gods and the stars, whether they want to indulge me or not.
- I will get the people close to Envakadi without actually taking them there, to protect their lives.
### Bumper
#### Beliefs
-  I seek to understand why the old world fell, to help better preserve this new one. Learning from creatures who were there at the time of reckoning should prove insightful.
- Monsters may be completely misunderstood- Kinda like the Roden. I want to know more about them- how they work, if I can cure them, and if they can be befriended.
- I may be Roden but I don't know if these "stars" are a sign from Acer. I will work towards understanding this new collection of lights.
