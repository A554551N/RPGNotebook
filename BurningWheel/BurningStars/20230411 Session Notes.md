- Bumper gave their beliefs first, Morwen will do Artha first
- [[Bumper]] is breakfasting with [[Dzahlal]] the Dwarven Merchant to discuss plans for accessing the ancient dwarfhold of **M'rakn A'plana**
	- Bumper refuses help from Dzahlal, allowing him to send only a single dwarf and provisions because he is concerned that any more will attract attention in the wastes and anger the Custodian.
	- Dzahlal agrees to have a copy of the stolen Elven Atlas page made for Bumper so that he can keep the original.
- [[Morwen]] asks [[Dhitroth]] to find a nice rock for [[Bumper]]
- [[Morwen]] visits [[Marshal]]
	- Marshal introduces Morwen to her great-nephew **Rasvan**
	- The conversation is incredibly awkward.  Marshal and his family are clearly uncomfortable around New Morwen
	- Marshal questions Morwen's new demeanor, worries that she's changed.
	- Marshal pities Morwen's immortality, suggests that it would drive him insane.
- [[Bumper]] visits the [[Roden Quarter]] to meet with a Father of Aecer named **Wheatblossom**
	- Bumper recognizes that the symbol of Aecer is an elven character for 'Alacrity' blended with the elven character of 'Divinity'
	- In discussion with the priest, Bumper learns that there was a time when Aecer 'kicked everyone else out of Heaven' because of the actions of something called '[[Galuchanar|The Cold One]]'
	- The actions of the Cold One are described in the Rodens **Book of the Prophets** in the **Epistle of Possett, who is known as the Great Betrayer**
	- In the **Epistle**, Possett describes how the warren is decimated by a strange curse that leaves dead Roden with no obvious wounds (in the same way that the **Custodian** feeds).  At the end of the Epistle, Possett decides to steal out into the Dark to confront the Cold Ones
- Morwen and Bumper meet in Dzahlal's Vault
	- Morwen attempts to recall if there is an elven god that uses Aecer's sigil (Ob: 6, History of the Ones Who Lost the War).  She fails and can't recall.
	- Morwen gives Bumper a friend rock, and they reconcile somewhat
	- They talk about the Custodian in front of **Vojnik**, Dzahlal's Guard.
