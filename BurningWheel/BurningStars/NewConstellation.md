# The New Constellation
- The Men we've met believe it is the emblem of the Pheonix King, a mighty (long dead) ruler, and symbolizes the ascension of mankind over the old races.
- Dwarves believe the Constellation is **Morag's Hammer**, a sign of their missing chief god Morag.  Interestingly of all the races, they seem the least concerned about it.
- Morwen believes the Constellation is a corrupted form of the **Nightweaver**, an elven Goddess of Fate.  We haven't met any other elves to see what they think.
- The Roden believe the Constellation is the Sign of **Aecer**, creator of the Roden.  The Society believes that this is the sign they've been waiting for to launch their invasion of the surface world.
