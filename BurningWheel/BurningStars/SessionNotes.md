- After getting Jam & Rak to a surgeon, Morwen & Bumper emerge from the inn to find the entire village of Sibiu in the steets staring up at the night sky.  For the first time in 100 years, a constellation burns in the dark.  What does it mean?
- **Constellation Beliefs**
	- The Mayor of Sibiu proclaims that the constellation is a Phoenix and represents the rise of Man from the ashes.  The village believes him fervently.
	- The Roden Preacher believes that the constellation is the sigil of Aecer and proves it is time for the Roden to emerge and scour the world of humanity.
	- The Dwarf tavernman believes it is the **Hammer of Morag**, and points the way to the ancient **Dwarven Halls**
- Morwen tries to convince the townsfolk to reject the Mayor's plan to follow the [[NewConstellation]].  She fails and [NPCs](NPCs#^2124d8) falls under the Mayor's sway.
- The gang opens the Door from session 1
- In the ancient temple/planetarium behind the door, Morwen sings the Lament of Stars and realizes that the constellation of the Nightweaver (chief god of the elven pantheon) has been replaced by the New Constellation
- Bumper found a fallen star-crystal in the Temple
- Morwen climbs to the ceiling of the room and places the missing star-crystal in a hidden socket in the New Constellation.  Climbing down, she sees the Nightweaver constellation back in its place before the stone falls again and the constellation's stones turn red again.
- When viewed from above, the ancient elven citadels form a burning wheel (5 points, one broken, Envakadi in the center)
- The Custodian's weird black eye has the New Constellation trapped within it.
- The Custodian believes that the Sibiu road on the floor map is broken because it keeps him from going home.
- The Temple has all of the old constellations in the ceiling and a map of the world on the floor.

# 2-22-22
- Morwen & Bumper get the Custodian's backstory
	- He was banished from Envakadi over his love for the Etharch
	- Before being banished he was a scholar of the stars.  He was given his position as Custodian in exchange for never returning to Envakadi.
- Morwen promises the Custodian food.
	- Morwen found two Roden poisoning the food supply wagons.  She catches them in the act and convinces them to follow her back to the Tower.
	- Bumper begs Morwen not to feed the Roden to them, but she does it anyway.
- The Village departs from Sibiu with the Society Roden, the Party, and the Custodian in tow.
- Bumper finds the appropriate herbs to counteract the poison the Roden put into the food.  He shows Marshall and Morwen how to harvest it.
	- The Test was successful (taking 4 hours), and the Party returns from the woods just as the Roden launch their sudden but inevitable betrayal.
	- Bumper wants Marshall to take credit for the Herbal remedy.

# 3-22-22
- The Society Roden attacked the camp after everyone was drugged
	- Bumper fought a Duel of Wits against the Society Leader
		- Society Leader won w/ compromise.  Agreed to leave the people alive if Bumper joined the Society.
	- **Morwen** took two of the Roden to feed to the **Custodian** during the fighting.
		- Bumper caught her doing it and they argued.  Bumper decided not to push it (and risk failing Persuasion), so Morwen took the Roden into the woods to be consumed.
		- The **Custodian** appeared from nowhere in the woods to take the offering.  He convinced Morwen that the best route for dealing with rogue Roden is to bring them to him.  He also asked her to bring any humans beyond saving to the edge of the woods for...burial.
	- Morwen healed the baker's wife, who had been stabbed by a Roden with help from Bumper.
	- Why is the Custodian so willing to do as Morwen says?

# 4-5-22
* Bumper attends Society Meetings
	* The Roden are looking for Crochett and Dave, two Roden who went missing (and were eaten) during the raid.
* The caravan is driven off-course by Morwen's sabotage, they end up at a Dwarven trading post some 3 days away from **Envakadi**
	* Morwen meets up again with an old companion [Achamaz Vedzizhev](NPCs.md#^b811c6), a Dwarven Skald.  Achamaz is working on a scheme to heist an ancient **Star Atlas** from a wealthy merchant in the post.
* Two of the Roden that were looking for rocks to give to Morwen (Scratch & Ralph) were attacked in the woods by the **Custodian**, Scratch escapes but Ralph is captured.
* Morwen heads into the woods to bargain for Ralph's life.  She offers two of the villagers (as opposed to the Custodian's offer of one of his choice.)
	* When Ralph is freed, he immediately points out that Morwen appears to control the monster.  Morwen is not able to intimidate him into silence, and he resolves to tell everyone.
* During the follow-up argument between Morwen and Bumper, the Custodian appears.
	* Morwen declares Bumper an Elf-friend, and the Custodian revealed that he still has the rock Bumper gave him.
	* Bumper wakes up the next morning and finds a rock carefully engraved with the elven rune for *Friendship* in his hand.

# 5-3-22
- **Achamaz** summons the Wardens to hunt the woods for signs of the **Custodian**.
	- Morwen implores the Custodian not to kill off all the wardens, and instead to distract them so that the group can help **Achamaz**.
- The Custodian begins to detail his plans to enter Envakadi.
	- The Gates are guarded by others like him.  Others that the Custodian believes are more dangerous than him ("I am but a simple scholar, how much more powerful would a soul be that is dipped in ***aeons*** of violence.")
	- To get through the gates, the Custodian believes that they will have to sacrifice the caravan of humans to distract the monsters.
- Achamaz puts his plan into effect to steal the **Celestial Atlas**
	- Morwen meets [Dzhalal Vedzizhev](NPCs.md#^d7ba02), a dwarf merchant and current owner of the Atlas.  She is posing as a seller of Elven antiquities.
	- Dzhalal seems less interested in buying scrolls and more interested in buying a title of Elf-friend.  When Morwen wouldn't sell that to him.  He purchased instead a promise that she would never give another dwarf the title.
- Bumper snuck into the trophy room through a nearby vent system
	- Bumper steals the Atlas, the Manual of the Stars, and a fancy rock
	- Dzhalal opened the door just as Bumper was leaving and sent guards to find out where they would come out.
	- Panicking, Bumper called out for help from the Custodian who heard them through the magic in the friend-stone.  He aided them by killing the two guards and teleporting Bumper out of the dwarven caves.
- The Custodian's dramatic rescue left him winded and without energy.  Going below ground rapidly saps his strength
	- To survive the dawning (when his power naturally wanes), he will need to consume living essence before the sun crests the horizon.  Bumper is the only person around that can help him find food.
	- The Custodian doesn't consume dwarves, as Greed has a bitter flavor.

# 5-24-22
* **Bumper** considers letting the Custodian feed on him but realizes it would likely be fatal.  Instead he chooses to try and convince the leader of the Roden to come out into the field to be devoured instead.
	* He fails the Test and the Priest's lieutenant is sent out instead.
	* The Custodian kills the Lieutenant, and Bumper decides to introduce the Custodian to the Society as their prophet.
	* Bumper fails to convince the Society prophet.
* **Morwen** goes looking for Bumper and has an argument with **The Society Prophet**
	* She insults them to their face and tells them their god is fake.
	* She gets to leave because he doesn't want to risk the Rodens' lives in a fight against Morwen but promises that the next time she sleeps that they would find her.
* **Morwen** and **Marshall** have a heartfelt bonding moment where Marshall ponders the new constellation and wonders what it might mean.
* **Morwen** learns of the **Lament of Galuchanar** that is also posessed by **Dhazalal**
	* She decides to go back and convince him to show it to her.
	* The story is of an elf who succumbs to grief when his lover rejects him.  He becomes a beast and cannot rest until he destroys the source of his grief.  "Until he consumes the heart that tormented him"
	* Morwen helps to get a birthday present for **Achamaz**, who is **Dhazalal**'s estranged son.  She hopes the gift will help reunite them (?)
	* Morwen also offers to Dhazalal the opportunity to come see the Star-Temple in Sibiu one day so that he can see the sky the way he remembers it.

# 5-31-22
* Achamaz gets his birthday present, discovers that the Star Atlas was lost (the Custodian has it)
* Bumper meets with the 'good Roden' that live beneath the Dwarf mines.  The priest there thinks that the sign in the sky can't be from Aecer as Aecer lives beneath the ground.
* **DUEL OF WITS** - Morwen attempts to convince Marshall to stay in the Dwarven Post with his family.
	* **Marshall** describes the root of Sibiu's new faith.  The Phoenix of the New Order arose in the sky on the 100th anniversary of the death of the last king of Men.  They believe that he has ascended to godhood and now guides the remaining people to safety and prosperity in the remains of Envakadi.
	* Marshall is defeated in the Duel with a major compromise (using the Custodian).  He insists that if he is to stay behind that the people of Sibiu know the truth of their quest (that they're sacrifices)
* **Bumper** uses the Astral Atlas with the Custodian
	* The day the stars fell, all of the stars in the atlas wrench as though ripping loose of their moorings.
	* The day the stars returned, several stars merged and formed the glowing constellation everybody is up in arms about.
* **Morwen** decides to allow the Custodian to feed on her, to find out whether doing so will allow her to aid her father if/when they find him.
	* Morwen succeeded at her Will Test to avoid the negative effects of feeding.  What will happen next?

# 8-2-22
