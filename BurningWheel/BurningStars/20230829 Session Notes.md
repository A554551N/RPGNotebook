- [[Bumper]] heads out to Elberd's farm and asks to borrow his barn for a couple hours (to talk to the [[Custodian]])
	- He asks the [[Custodian]] to teach him the Air of Gates.  The [[Custodian]] explains that he cannot.
	- Bumper asks the [[Custodian]] if he could scout for other entrances into [[Mrak'n A'plana]].  There were Roden traveling back and forth who might know another way in.
	- The [[Custodian]] departs immediately, and will be away for two days.
- [[Kornelie]] makes a Circles test to try and find a friend amongst the Host.  She bombs it and instead gets her brother [[Aloise]].
	- [[Aloise]] wants [[Kornelie]] to forego her claim on [[Mrak'n A'plana]] in exchange for 10 Cash Dice and a place in the Host.  If he can convince her to take it, he will get a promotion.
	- [[Kornelie]] refuses his overtures, and [[Aloise]] becomes angry.  He declares that he will ensure he is made commander of the mission to [[Mrak'n A'plana]] and will die before he allows [[Kornelie]] to enter the Old Mountain.
- [[Bumper]] makes friends with some surface Roden led by a Missionary called Parsley who is on his way with a company of Roden to the surface of [[Mrak'n A'plana]].  They're seeking a Society nest reportedly somewhere nearby.  [[Bumper]] asks if they can sign onto the expedition with [[Kornelie]] and the [[Custodian]]
	- The Roden discovers that [[Bumper]] is from **Trochlear Nest**, which is a Society Stronghold.  Bumper attempts to express his unique take on the Word of Aecer (Doctrine) and fails, leaving the other Roden suspicious.
- [[Kornelie]] attempts to locate records from the time of [[Mrak'n A'plana]] in the [[Kamazamka]] records hall.  They have all been deliberately defaced.
- During the meeting with [[Timir Bulat Magomedov]], [[Kornelie]] decides that it's not worth attempting to negotiate with the Prince because he's clearly not on board with handing the Mountain over to her.
- Bumper refuses to turn over the information on the Door without an Oath for the safety of the [[Custodian]].
- The party decides to attempt to join Parsley's Crusade
- [[Kornelie]] swears to a binding Oath to [[Bumper]]: "All species who aid in the sitting of a Bonejaw upon the throne of [[Mrak'n A'plana]] will be welcomed and protected by the Ruling House in perpetuity."
