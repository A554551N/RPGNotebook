- Arriving a day from [[Kamazamka]], [[Bumper]] and [[Kornelie]] see the fortress-mountain and its  surrounding fields being tended by farmer dwarves.
	- It's pointed out that the [[Custodian]] will need to eat while he waits for the party to return.  Kornelie is understandably concerned about the idea of him eating dwarves.
	- She insists that he shouldn't eat dwarves, but fails the Steel test and flees from his presence.
	- She runs into a helpful farmer dwarf who gives them a lift into the City.
	- He mentions that Field Roden missionaries sometimes come from East (toward [[Mrak'n A'plana]]) to trade for food and goods.
- [[Kamazamka]] is a volcano, and the heat is harnessed from there to power lifts and mechanisms throughout.
- The group passes into the mountain after a light altercation with the Wardens over Kornelie's Outsider-ness.
	- Bumper checks out a junk shop run by a guy who's pretty clearly robbing dead bodies from the Eastern road
		- Bumper searches the piles of scrap behind the stall hoping to find anything connected to the elves or the constellations, he discovers an elven knife stabbed into a set of armor and a shitty beaten iron pendant with the [[Shadow Weaver]]'s mark on it that clearly wasn't made by Dwarven or Elven hands.
		- The blade bears two inscriptions "Pesta", probably an owner's name, and "Rembulon" which means 'Moonlight'
		- The group tries to buy the dagger off of the merchant (Ob 4 Resources) and fails
	- [[Kornelie]] goes into the tunnels in search of her friend Shovda, a Delver.
		- Shovda tells Kornelie that the underground gates to [[Mrak'n A'plana]] remain sealed despite years of effort by delvers to open them.
		- She offers to show Kornelie the worksite after her shift in exchange for a drink.
