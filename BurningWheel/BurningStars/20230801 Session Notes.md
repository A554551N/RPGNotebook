- Arriving a day from [[Kamazamka]], [[Bumper]] and [[Kornelie Bonejaw]] see the fortress-mountain and its  surrounding fields being tended by farmer dwarves.
	- It's pointed out that the [[Custodian]] will need to eat while he waits for the party to return.  Kornelie is understandably concerned about the idea of him eating dwarves.
	- She insists that he shouldn't eat dwarves, but fails the Steel test and flees from his presence.
	- She runs into a helpful farmer dwarf who gives them a lift into the City.
	- He mentions that Field Roden missionaries sometimes come from East (toward [[Mrak'n A'plana]]) to trade for food and goods.
