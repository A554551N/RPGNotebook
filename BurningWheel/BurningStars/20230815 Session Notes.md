- At about 11p in [[Kamazamka]], Shovda brings [[Kornelie]] and [[Bumper]] to the door that leads to [[Mrak'n A'plana]].
	- Bumper sees that there is Elven script beneath the Dwarven carvings.  Reading them with an Elven Script test, he realizes that he needs someone to sing the Air of Gates to open the door.
	- Shovda points out that there has been sabotage at the gates of late.  She thinks that someone is challenging the Prince for access to [[Mrak'n A'plana]].  Maybe someone else has found a way in?
	- Shovda mentions that it feels like the excavation is cursed, tools break, tunnels collapse, tunnel spider nests are breached.  Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.
	- Kornelie fails a perception test to note the conflict on Shovda's face.  She resolves to warn someone that Kornelie and Bumper intend to open the door.
	- [[Bumper]] attempts to quickly summon the [[Custodian]] while no one is around.  He arrives (at great cost to his power) and agrees to sing the Air of Gates if that's what Bumper *really* wants.  He notes that it will be loud and will certainly draw attention.
	- In the meanwhile [[Kornelie]] hears dwarves coming
