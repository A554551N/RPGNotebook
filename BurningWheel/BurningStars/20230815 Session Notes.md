- At about 11p in [[Kamazamka]], Shovda brings [[Kornelie]] and [[Bumper]] to the door that leads to [[Mrak'n A'plana]].
	- Bumper sees that there is Elven script beneath the Dwarven carvings.  Reading them with an Elven Script test, he realizes that he needs someone to sing the Air of Gates to open the door.
	- Shovda points out that there has been sabotage at the gates of late.  She thinks that someone is challenging the Prince for access to [[Mrak'n A'plana]].  Maybe someone else has found a way in?
