## Nazhmudin the Dwarf
**Age:** 189
Believes the [[NewConstellation]] is **Morag's Hammer**, and will lead the Dwarves back to the ancient Dwarven Halls

## The Monster (The Custodian of the Spire)
Trapped alone in the Spire for a hundred years, maddened by grief and corrupted by magic.  The Custodian of the Spire has become a monster.  Stretched and distended, it continually relives the worst day of its life.  Morwen offered it a chance to rejoin the other elves in Envakadi in exchange for not murdering the people of Sibiu.

### The Lament of Galuchanar
*The Lament of Galuchanar is an ancient elven tale of a Knight of Envakadi who succumbs to grief and hatred after his lover rejects him.  In his black-hearted fury he became a beast that shall never rest until he has the heart that was denied to him.*
Lysa & Aki believe that Galuchanar is the true name of the Custodian.  They are wrong, but Galuchanar is still alive.  Morwen's distant ancestor was the maid the Knight sought so desperately, and the Custodian has sensed this of her and intends to offer her to him in order that he may slip passed.

### Belief
- *The way to **Envakadi** is barred by spiteful creatures and wicked monsters.  To pass, we must offer them a sacrifice.  The entire village of Sibiu should do.
- *The Roden, Bumper, displays an innocence I have long forgotten.  I will ensure its survival in the bloodbath that is to come.*
- *Galuchanar stalks the streets of Envakadi seeking the heart of his beloved. I will give to him what he seeks so that we may pass safely to the Sanctum of Stars.*

## Gibi, the Prophet of Sibiu
