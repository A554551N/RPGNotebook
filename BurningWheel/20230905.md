# 20230905 Session Notes
**Strong Start:** The Admiralty Board has called Jerica into the Fort two weeks after the investigation of [[Baldur Vidar]]'s workshop.  Rumors continue to swirl about unrest among the dockworkers and Lynwood wants Jerica to help put a stop to it (Lynwood actually wants her to refuse orders so that he can punish her).
- [[Jerica]] visits [[Vizzini]] after her meeting with the admirals to get a list of soldiers who have been given orders to assist her in capturing any rebels hiding amongst the dockworkers and other lower class folks.
- [[Jerica]] has also been issued a building for her use in the area until the case is resolved.
