Barbury Island is the exclusive property of the [[Imperial Navy]], the majority of which is closed to even most naval personnel as part of [[Graham House]].

Beneath the island is a labyrinth of laboratories and offices that originally comprised [[Project Leviathan]] and was later used to house Project [[Indomitable]] during the years of Marcus' imprisonment there.

In the lowest chamber of the complex is a natural cavern that opens to an underground pool.  Within it, one can see the singular eye of an [[Ancient Beast]] in some kind of stasis just below the surface (Studying it was the purpose of [[Project Leviathan]])
