# History of the Admiralty Board
After the [[Mists]] desceneded, the **Emergency Naval Reorganization Act** was put forward to restructure the command of the [[Imperial Navy|3rd Division of the Imperial Navy]] to reflect their sudden isolation from the chain of command.  Five of the most powerful Captains in the Navy at the time appointed themselves the first Pantillarian Admiralty Board, whose first act was to grant the rank of Lord Admiral to its members.

Their second act was to name one of their number to serve as **The Lord Admiral of the Pantelleria**.  The position was initially created to serve as a 'first among equals' and to resolve disputes between the competing interests of the Admirals of the Board.  Over time, successive Lord Admirals consolidated power in the office.  By the time of [[Lord Admiral Mason]], the islands are almost entirely run by the Office of the Lord Admiral and the Admiralty Board has been reduced to managing the affairs of the Navy and their individual estates.
