# History of the Admiralty Board
After the [[Mists]] desceneded, the **Emergency Naval Reorganization Act** was put forward to restructure the command of the [[Imperial Navy|3rd Division of the Imperial Navy]] to reflect their sudden isolation from the chain of command.  Five of the most powerful Captains in the Navy at the time appointed themselves the first Pantillarian Provisional Admiralty Board, whose first act was to grant the rank of Admiral to its members.

Their second act was to name one of their number to serve as **The Lord Admiral of the Pantelleria**.  The position was initially created to serve as a 'first among equals' and to resolve disputes between the competing interests of the Admirals of the Board.  Over time, successive Lord Admirals consolidated power in the office.  By the time of [[Lord Admiral Mason]], the islands are almost entirely run by the Office of the Lord Admiral and the Admiralty Board has been reduced to managing the affairs of the Navy and their individual estates.

# Powers of the Admiralty Board
The Admiralty Board sets Naval policy and budgets, as well as making high level strategic decisions about the Navy's aims.  They have the authority to pass Edicts of the Board (essentially laws) by majority vote and the Lord Admiral's approval.  The Admiralty Board is also required to sign off on all Officer promotions and determines ship assignments for commissioned officers (though this duty is typically delegated to the [[Vizzini|Secretary of the Board]]).

The Admiralty Board also retains the power to unseat the Lord Admiral of the Pantelleria, but doing so requires a unanimous vote.  In the history of the isles, such a thing has never occurred.
