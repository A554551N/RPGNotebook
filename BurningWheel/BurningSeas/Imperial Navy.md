The **3rd Division of the Imperial Navy** was stationed at **Port Armadel** to support the Emperor's goals  in the farthest reaches of the Empire when the **Mists** fell.  Cut off from the chain of command, the superior captains of the Division organized an emergency action to form the [[Admiralty Board|Pantellerian Admiralty Board]] and instituted a decree of Martial Law that is technically still in force today.

# Ranks
- **Lord Admiral** (Currently [[Lord Admiral Mason]])
	- Lord Admiral's Secretary ([[Westley Gibson|Cpt. Westley Gibson]])
- 5 **Admirals** (the [[Admiralty Board]]).  Each Admiral is nominally responsible for a portion of the region and controls a single detachment of the Navy's full force complement.
	- The [[Vizzini||Secretary of the Navy]] is responsible for translating the edicts of the Board into policies for the Navy to carry out.  The Secretary's Office handles much of the day-to-day operation of the Navy and it is widely understood that the Secretary of the Navy is the second most powerful person in the Navy (behind the [[Lord Admiral Mason|Lord Admiral]])
- ~60 **Captains** assigned to the various Admirals.  Despite what their rank suggests, not every Captain is actively in command of a vessel.  The commander of a Naval Fort is also granted the rank of Captain, as are leadership in the logistics corps.  In order to attain the rank of Captain an examination is required, and all Captains are required to maintain certification in the art of naval warfare so that they can be assigned a ship if necessary.
- An unknown number of **Marine Commanders** responsible for heading up the shipborne troops of the Navy
- **Marine Lieutenants & Marine Sergeants** lead troops in battle
- **Lieutenants**.  Each ship maintains a complement of senior officers, each the lead for their specialty.  Specialties include: **Sails, Navigation, Gunnery, Logistics**.  The ship also has a 1st mate (Quartermaster or Commander) responsible for communicating the Captain's orders to the crew and administering discipline.
- **Ship's Mates** work under their respective Lieutenants to carry out the operation of the ship
- **Sailors** are general labor aboard the ship
- **Marines** are the combat complement of a Naval ship, they're trained to fight from ships and boats and are well trained in amphibious assault techniques.
