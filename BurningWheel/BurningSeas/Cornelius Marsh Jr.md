Son of [[Doctor Cornelius Marsh]] and Master Gunner of the Harrier, he didn't know about his father's treasonous activities.  Instead, believing in governmental reform, he joined the Imperial Navy.

After the death of his father at the hands of [[Jerica]] during the [[Battle of Storm Base]], he was taken by the Navy to be interrogated regarding his family's involvement in the rebellion.
