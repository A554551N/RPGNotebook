*Rebel Leader, Coalition Builder, Father of [[Cornelius Marsh Jr]]*

Doctor Cornelius Marsh taught and wrote books about the history of the [[Pantelleria]] for the University.  His keen understanding of the past and a wide view of the increasing power of the [[Imperial Navy]] led him to begin working to quietly check their power.  When more conventional methods failed, he began gathering resources to use in open revolt against them.

Over the next 15 years, Marsh became an expert in revolutionary & guerilla tactics and built a coalition of dissidents from across the archipelago.

His greatest achievement was the joint rebel construction of [[Storm Base]], which served as the staging ground for the fledgling Rebel Navy and as a research station into the strange creatures that appear to dwell beneath the islands (The [[Ancient Beast|Ancient Beasts]]).  He was fascinated with the creatures, and eventually recruited [[Baldur Vidar]] to help understand what they were trying to teach the people of the [[Pantelleria]] (and especially how to use their power for weapons to fight the [[Imperial Navy|Navy]].)

[[Jerica]] killed Marsh after the [[Battle of Storm Base]] to prevent him from being tortured by [[Lord Admiral Mason]]'s soldiers.
