# Design
The Naval Light Frigate is square-rigged with three masts and has a hull length of just over 130ft with an average draught of 13ft.  Naval frigates can maintain speeds as high as 14 knots (~16mph).

Unlike larger ships of the Imperial Navy, the Light Frigate carries all 24 of its guns in a single deck above the berth deck where crew were quartered.
