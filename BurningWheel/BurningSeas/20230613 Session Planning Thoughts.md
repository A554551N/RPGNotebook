The new Situation should be inherently challenging to Jerica's beliefs.  As the Revolution fractures, the government will crack down to try and capture other leaders and participants before they reform or disappear.

I should offer a mix of rebels who are sympathetic and others that are hardliners like Marsh was.  Maybe a terrorist attack of some kind?

I also want to escalate the threat of the awakening Things, since Mason has been successful in his schemes.  I'm not sure how he actually wakes one up.  What do they want?

I also want to step up the pressure on her village from systemic problems.  Obviously laws are passed to restrict freedoms for the proles in the wake of the rebellion.  Taxes are almost certainly raised as a punitive measure.

*I can bring these two threats together by having rebels take from the village or by having the village be quietly supporting a rebel cell.  The pressure is brought to bear by an inspection by Naval Investigators being prompted by an admiral who feels threatened by Jerica's new methods.*
