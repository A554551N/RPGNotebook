**Strong Start:** Jerica goes to visit the Foreman in prison and discovers the extent of his mistreatment

- Jerica returns to the city and puts [[Keiran]] and herself up at [[Westley Gibson|Westley's]],
- She visits the fort and decides to visit the [[Foreman]]
	- The [[Foreman]] is being treated badly, he's lost weight and has obviously been beaten.  He explains that the Navy believes that he knows something about the rebellion and is trying to beat it out of him.
	- He won't admit whether or not he knows anything to Jerica (he does, of course)
	- He reveals to Jerica that the guards that arrested them after the fight told the court about their visit to [[Jeremy Roberts|Jeremy's]] for medical treatment.
	- Jerica promises to help him get free.
- [[Jerica]] visits [[Jeremy Roberts]]
	- During the conversation she discovers that the price of painkillers has increased fivefold recently.
	- Jeremy is on a waitlist to receive his stock from the Navy (Jerica thinks this is because they suspect him of being aligned with the Foreman)
	- He tells  her about how he'd been visited by guards multiple times to determine whether he was involved with the Foreman's rebellion cell.  He eventually threw a shoe at them and told them to arrest him if they had evidence.
