# 20230919 Session Notes
**Strong Start:** [[Jerica]] returns to [[Westley Gibson]]'s house.  She overhears Gibson Sr. yelling at Westley about "the common whore he's keeping around" amid threats to disown Westley if he doesn't break things off with [[Jerica]].
- [[Jerica]] slips out of the Gibson House without attracting attention (leaving a note with Eustace to explain where she's gone)
- She also visits [[Marcus Fields]] and finds him (as usual) sopping drunk.  He tells her that he's been given an ultimatum by the Admiralty board, either sober up or be fired.  He seems confident that he will be fired.
