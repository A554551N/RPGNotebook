**Strong Start:** Telling Mason about Baldur's Workshop
- [[Jerica]] takes [[Lord Admiral Mason]] aside and tells him about the existence of [[Baldur Vidar]]'s hidden workshop on the island.
	- She gives him the intel without asking anything in return
	- Before he leaves, Jerica asks him about staying the execution of [[The Foreman]]
	- Mason presents Jerica with evidence of the Foreman's interaction with rebel forces.  The situation is very suspicious but nothing conclusive could be proven.
