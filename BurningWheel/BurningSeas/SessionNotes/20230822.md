**Strong Start:** Telling Mason about Baldur's Workshop
- [[Jerica]] takes [[Lord Admiral Mason]] aside and tells him about the existence of [[Baldur Vidar]]'s hidden workshop on the island.
	- She gives him the intel without asking anything in return
	- Before he leaves, Jerica asks him about staying the execution of [[The Foreman]]
		- Mason presents Jerica with evidence of the Foreman's interaction with rebel forces.  The situation is very suspicious but nothing conclusive could be proven.
		- On an Ob 6 Persuasion Test, Jerica successfully convinces Mason to intervene on the Foreman's behalf
- Jerica rushes to the fort to prevent the execution and arrives as the noose is being dropped over the Foreman's head.  She passes a VS Speed Test against Lynwood to prevent him from dropping the lever.
- She takes the Foreman to [[Westley Gibson|Westley's]] house to recover.  He needs medical care.
