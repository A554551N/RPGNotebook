# 20231010 Session Notes
**Strong Start:**
*I didn't take notes live during this session.  [[Jerica]] discovered that a ship was going to be attacked by dissidents.  [[Jerica]] embedded herself into the crew of the target ship, and discovered that it was to be transporting human cargo from [[Graham House]].*

*She contacted [[Lord Admiral Mason]] who told her she must not interfere with the shipment.  He suggests letting the dissidents escape, and using them for intel later.*
