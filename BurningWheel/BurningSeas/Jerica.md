*Idealistic Pirate*
- Currently serves in the [[Imperial Navy]] under [[Lord Admiral Mason]]
- Romantically involved with both Admiral [[Marcus Fields]] and Captain [[Westley Gibson]]
- Fighting against the Revolution headed by [[Doctor Cornelius Marsh]]
- Formerly married to Doctor [[Jeremy Roberts]], with whom she had a daughter: [[Hope Roberts]]
- Captain of the [[Harrier]].  The first mate is her long-time friend [[Peyton]]

# Current Beliefs
- I will do what must be done to help Westley get a seat on the Board.  I failed to kill Lynwood, but perhaps I can do it without actually hurting him?
- I will be sure that the Lord Admiral does not unjustly punish Marsh Jr for his father's actions
