# 20231102 Session Notes
**Strong Start:** [[Melanion]] corners [[Cassandra]] to discuss the fact that he unknowingly pushed the [[TrokosNPCs#^534e8f|Exarch of Trokos]] to kill the [[TrokosNPCs#^b111eb|Archon]]
- [[Melanion]] opens up to [[Cassandra]] about how he feels responsible for [[TrokosNPCs#^b111eb|the Archon's]] death.
	- [[Cassandra]] decides not to tell him about how she could have helped the Archon after [[TrokosNPCs#^d96a6d|Skata]] stabbed him.  He wants to know whether he should tell [[Phaedra]]
- [[Cassandra]] wants to get necessary food and supplies to the people.
	- [[Melanion]] suggests convincing [[Enkavma]] to turn to [[Trokos]] in this time of need.  [[Cassandra]] counters by stating that the Enkavmans will never accept food from Trokos.
- Before leaving with the rest of the group to help drunken [[Perseus]] and Phaedra home, [[Sebastian]] asks [[Cassandra]] whether she will be safe without him.  She attempts to lie and tell him that she's not going anywhere.

> [!fail] BL Falsehood - Ob 3 
> [[Cassandra]] leaves [[Sebastian]] concerned that she is going to do something foolish.  He resolves to return to the uncle's home as quickly as possible so that he can protect her as he has sworn to do.
