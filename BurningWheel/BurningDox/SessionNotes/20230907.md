# 20230907 Session Notes
**Strong Start:** [[Cassandra]] meets her uncle again while [[Melanion]] does politics
- Cassandra is waffling on whether to knock on the door when it opens.  She is shocked, but identifies herself as the daughter of Ieria to her Uncle Zografikis and he invites them in.
	- He hasn't seen her in nearly 20 years (her father never brought her to Enkavma after her mother died)
	- He agrees to let [[Cassandra]] stay, but warns her that he has no hospitality to offer; times are lean.
- [[Melanion]] is invited to an afternoon meal with Syntrofos with [[Phaedra]], they are accompanied by the Exarch's guard.
