# Cassandra
## Beliefs
* Behind every powerful man, is a more powerful woman.
* I know of Andros and Stylvanius' plan to use the Arch-Mage as their own weapon, I will not allow this to happen, and stay neutral in my standings with the city states.
* `Empty`

## Instincts
- Never turn your back on a man, especially one you don't know.
- Always fight for the love and respect I deserve.
- Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer
	- **GM Note**: *I'm going to push for a rewrite on this, it's not an instinct as written.*
