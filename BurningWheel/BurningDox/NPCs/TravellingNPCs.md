# Characters
## Sebastian
*Sgt Sebastian is the current head of the Enkavmani barracks in [Kentriko](KentrikoNPCs.md) (Enkavmani territory since the most recent settlement).  He was friendly with [Cassandra](Cassandra.md), got her to go on a date with him, beat up [Melanion](Melanion.md) and during her escape with [Perseus](Perseus.md) he admitted he loved her before the boat sailed out of sight.*

- Sebastian has been hard for me to characterize.  He clearly cares for Cassandra but also pulls away at the thought of her being the Archmage.  Lysa really wants him to join the party, and I think it's a possibility, but I also think there's a chance that it fails and he goes back to Enkavma with the envoy.  I guess we'll see.

### Beliefs
- My duty to Enkavma is foremost.  I will protect the Envoy while in the den of the enemy.
- Assassins broke into the fort and nearly killed Cassandra, I will stay with her and lay down my life to guard her if necessary.

## Phaedra
Phaedra is the daughter of the [[TrokosNPCs#Exarch Andros|Exarch of Trokos]], and is traveling with the party so that she's safe while the Exarch begins revamping the city for [[Ouroboros]].  I'm not really sure what to do with her, but she seems to be stuck with the party so I guess I need to make her do something.

### Beliefs
Who the fuck knows man?
