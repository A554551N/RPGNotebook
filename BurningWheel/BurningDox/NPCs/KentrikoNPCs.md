# The Village of Kentriko
## NPCs
### Uncle Niko
*Uncle Niko is [Melanion](Melanion.md)'s uncle, but everyone calls him Uncle Niko.  He is the carpenter on board the **Lady Grace**, the ship captained by **Captain Navagio**.  He cares deeply for his nephew.  After arguing strenuously for Melanion to leave Perseus behind and flee to safety aboard the **Grace**, he stormed out and hasn't been seen since.  Before leaving, Melanion stole Niko's life savings to help them in Trokos.*

- Uncle Niko forgives Melanion for the theft (since the money was for Melanion anyway).

#### Beliefs
*On hold until he's on screen again*
