# The City-State of Trokos
## NPCs
### Delia
*Delia is [Perseus](Perseus.md) and [Cassandra](Cassandra.md)'s Aunt.  She is a weaver in Trokos and the center of a web of middle-class friends that she interacts with through regular meetings to play [Diaskedazo](../WorldNotes.md#diaskedazo) and trade rumors.*

#### Beliefs
- `Aunt Delia has moved a bit offscreen, I don't currently have any beliefs planned.`

### Skata
*Skata is a bureaucrat working in the Office of Military Logistics.  Officially his job is locating food for the troops and making sure the food ends up where it's supposed to go.  Unofficially, Skata is a spy working on behalf of the [Alliance](../WorldNotes.md) to destabilize Trokos from within.*
*He is interested in [Melanion](Melanion.md) as an asset.  So blindly loyal to Trokos that he might be willing to do some really terrible stuff if he believes it's for the good of the City.*

#### Beliefs
- `After saving him from the Cats, Skata has moved offscreen for now.`

### Exarch Andros
*The Exarch is the civic ruler of the city of Trokos.  He currently rules alongside the **Archon Stylvanius**.  His daughter is **Phaedra**.  Andros is handsome, middle-aged, and a consumate (if authoritarian) politicion.  He and Stylvanius make an effective team, even if they rarely see eye to eye.*

#### Beliefs
- **Stylvanius**' abuse of the Archon's emergency powers has gone too far.  I will prove his corruption to the electorate and demand his immediate removal.
	- *The Archmage has agreed to help get Andros' daughter out of the city to protect her from reprisals.  I think he knows that striking back against Stylvanius is likely to cost him his life (this is a result of the failed persuasion test from Mel)*

### Archon Stylvanius - Deceased
*The Archon is the foreign and military ruler of the city of Trokos.  He is responsible for managing affairs concerning State security, foreign relations, and warfare.  It is this last that the current Archon has hung his helmet on.  Stylvanius, also known as 'The Shark of Trokos', is widely regarded as the greatest general in the Thousand Isles.  He has held his seat as Archon since the year after the previous Archmage's death (19 years, 9.5 terms).*
*The Archon's cunning is well-known, and it is said he would sacrifice anything to end the war on his own terms.*

- I Took Perseus under my wing while his friends were busy and affirmed his love of Trokos.  I talked to him about the power of being Archmage, the respect the position brings, and the glory it can give to Trokos.  I **didn't** talk about 'responsibility', and certainly didn't talk about responsibility to the other islands.
- Stylvanius has emerged as a primary antagonist in Trokos.  He has done a fantastic job of undermining democracy in the city and marginalizing the traditional power of the Exarch under cover of his emergency powers.  He has lost several sons to the war, and has little left to drive him but hate for the Enkavmani.
- The Archon died at the hands of Skata, the Enkavman spy.  The Exarch hired the [Ouroboros](Ouroboros.md) assassins to do the deed, who subcontracted out to [Skata](TrokosNPCs.md#Skata).  Despite having the opportunity to help, [Cassandra](Cassandra.md) chose to do nothing to help and watched him bleed to death instead.

### Iosef
*Counsellor Iosef is the pre-eminent scholar of legal matters in the city.  A friend of **Aunt Delia**'s, she thought he would be a good match to help with the case.  Instead it turns out he's a real sleazeball.  If he's taking advantage of women, who knows what else he's doing?*
*Someone beat up Cassandra in his name.*

- [Cassandra](Cassandra.md) sent Iosef a message through his wife Avra that she intended to harm his business and social standing.  He's decided it would be easier for everyone involved if she were dead.
- I will use my political clout to be appointed as the Trokosi envoy to the Archmage, the better to ruin her.
- **I'm still not sure if Iosef burned down Aunt Delia's house.   It feels like the most likely outcome, but I kind of want to subvert this by revealing it as the first attempt on Cassandra's life by the [Ouroboros](Ouroboros.md)**

#### Beliefs
- [Cassandra](Cassandra.md) came into my house, **into MY HOUSE**, and ratted on me to **MY WIFE!**  This bitch is going to learn her place.

### Crag
***The Crag** is a mountain of a man, a pit fighting champion.  During [Melanion](Melanion.md)'s first fight, he knocked **The Crag** unconscious. **The Crag**, infuriated, demanded a rematch.  Melanion beat him up again.*

- I'm pretty sure Crag has had enough at this point.  The dice have very clearly shown that he's not up to dealing with Melanion.

#### Beliefs
- [Melanion](Melanion.md) believes he can make a mockery of **The Crag**, but **The Crag** is a champion!  **The Crag** will round up some boys and show him what happens when he doesn't show **The Crag** proper respect.

## Minor NPCs
- **Counsellor Theofylaktos** - a young legal counsellor who aided the group in their meeting with the archon.  A friend of **Skata**.
- **One-Eyed Stevos** - Old, barely four foot tall, big beard, one eye.  Runs the fight club on the docks.
	- **Belief** - [Melanion](Melanion.md) has the potential to bring in a lot of profit if we set it up right.  I'll find the meanest Enkavman I can and put on a show!
	- [Melanion](Melanion.md) convinced him to back off a little.  Stevos is setting up a fight with a strong Enkavman to set Melanion up as "The Hero of Trokos".  He promised Stevos that if the Enkavman takes him down that he won't get up.  They'll make a bundle.
- **Phaedra** - Daughter of the **Exarch**, currently attending university.  Trying to get with [Perseus](Perseus.md).  [Melanion](Melanion.md) is trying to get with her.
	- Her life is in danger as a result of Mel's failed persuasion of the Exarch above, he wants to take her out of the City with the crew when they leave to protect her from the Archon's retribution.
- **Moustaki** - A random pita vendor
- **Volsenik** - The leader of the [Arkmagos Council](Arkmagos%20Council.md)
- **Uncle Simeon** - Mel's Uncle, the doorman at the Exarch's house.
- **Papoutsi** - A runner in service to Skata.
- **Epikoinon** - The Enkavman envoy to Trokos
	- Something of a friend of the **Exarch**.
	- Solicited [Cassandra](Cassandra.md) to convince the **Archon** to free Enkavman POWs, this gains him great acclaim back home when she is successful.
