# The Brotherhood of the Ouroboros
- A shadowy organization that contests the Archmage and their goals.
- **Conjecture:** The organization was originally founded by the first archmage's twin to ensure that the world is protected from an Archmage who goes rogue (Clearly at some point this belief changed to the concept that the world shouldn't have an Archmage at all.  Why?

## Known Members

## Tactics
I'm seeing the Ouroboros as a Templar-like organization at the moment, subverting and seizing control of governments and powerful figures to an unknown end.  They're clearly working to damage the Archmage and are an enemy of the Arkmagos, and have been shown to utilize assassins to achieve their goals.
