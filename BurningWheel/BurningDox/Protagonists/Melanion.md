# Melanion
## Beliefs
- The Games are coming up - and I want to win a Laurel in the marathon. I must be ready. My training cannot stop simply because of victory in the qualifiers. I must find other avenues to improve myself.
- The Exarch is worried about Phaedra, if he confronts the Archon. I'll keep her safe from any reprisals - this is my fault after all.
- `Empty`

## Instincts
* When Phaedra asks me a question, stammer and trip over my own tongue.
