# Perseus
*Perseus is 20 and has recently begun exhibiting signs of magical talent.  About the same time, a band of soldiers from the enemy land of **Enkavma** arrived to take him into custody.  With help from his sister [Cassandra](Cassandra.md) and his best friend [Melanion](Melanion.md), he escaped their clutches and is now grappling with his destiny in Trokos.*
*After [[Cassandra]] is appointed Archmage, Perseus is angry that the honor was not bestowed upon him.  After a while he gets over it, at least on the surface, and applies himself to his studies.  During the events in Kentriko, he nearly kills [[TravellingNPCs#Phaedra|Phaedra]] and [[Melanion]] with uncontrolled magic.  Now he is seeking a way to remove his magic so he doesn't hurt anyone else.*
