## Challenging Beliefs
### Melanion
- ~~Schedule a qualifying race for the same time as Percy's Testing~~
- ~~[The Crag](NPCs/TrokosNPCs.md#Crag) is looking for a reason to fuck him up~~
- ~~[One-Eyed Stevos](NPCs/TrokosNPCs.md) wants to get Melanion to throw a big fight so he can make some money.~~
- I want to deeply embed Mel into [Perseus](Perseus.md)'s ongoing drama, but I'm having a hard time doing it.
	- I've decided to instead push on Mel's desire to do things outside of Perseus, to see how far I can strain their friendship.  Does he choose his newfound cosmopolitan life or his lifelong friend?
	- ~~Mel's race is the same time as Perseus' ascension hearing.  Mel is intending to run the race and try to get back in time.  This seems like a good place to reinsert [Crag](NPCs/TrokosNPCs.md#Crag).~~

### Cassandra
- Cassandra is aggressively rejecting the Hero's Journey, [Aunt Delia](NPCs/TrokosNPCs.md#delia) is going to turn her into a mistress of intrigue (and voice of reason) to work at Perseus' side and protect him.
	- I see this working as a process wherein Delia invites her to join [Diaskedazo](WorldNotes.md#diaskedazo) games and shows her friends.  Make a point of showing how Delia learns things from the games, and how she seems to always have the right friend for any occasion.
- Iosef wants to put the hurt on Cassandra
	- How bad will he hurt Aunt Delia to make it happen?
		- Given what happened last session?  Badly.
- ~~The Archon is going to work to aggressively convert [Perseus](Perseus.md), need to figure out a way to make it obvious without inviting her to sit in.~~
	- This happened while the rest of the group pursued downtime that kept them away from the palace.

## Outside Pressures
- The envoys of the other nations are all going to be under the Archon's roof.  To draw public support for the war effort, he is going to have 'Enkavmani' assassins take a swing at [Perseus](Perseus.md), himself, and the head of the neutral country.  His goal is for them to try to commit these crimes and fail.  His investigators stand ready to declare the attackers Enkavmani instigators, and then to banish them from his hall for violating the laws of a houseguest.
- It's time for the cult that opposes the Archmage to make an appearance (and be given a name).  What can they do to show off their existence without being too overt?
- If the Games happen, one of the city states will attack it.

## Uncategorized Thinking
- The Ouroborosi want the war to continue.  They have successfully brokered a deal with the Exarch to remove the corrupt [Stylvanius](NPCs/TrokosNPCs#Archon%20Stylvanius).  The party has recently flushed out an Enkavman Spy ([Skata](NPCs/TrokosNPCs#Skata)).  The [Ouroboros](NPCs/Ouroboros.md) will offer him sanctuary if he will be the knife used against the Archon so that they can blame his death on the Enkavmani.
	- The Exarch will then utilize the surge of populist support for the war following the Archon's death to ride to electoral victory in Trokos, and the [Ouroboros](NPCs/Ouroboros.md) will have a well-placed leader to continue their trek toward world domination (or whatever they want).
