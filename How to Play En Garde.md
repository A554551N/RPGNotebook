## Character
### Combat Statistics
Your character has a number of statistics used in duels.  Here are a summary of what they do.  **Strength**, **Expertise**, and **Constitution** are determined by rolling 3d6.  **Endurance** is calculated based on **Strength** and **Constitution**.
#### Strength
**Strength** represents your character's physical fitness and is primarily used to determine how much damage you deal when you strike during a duel.  It's also a factor in **Endurance** as described below.
#### Expertise
**Expertise** represents your character's skill with a blade.  During a duel, the character with the higher Expertise is required to script ahead less, and can sometimes act more quickly than a character with lower Expertise.
#### Constitution
**Constitution** represents your character's toughness and healing ability.  After a duel, Constitution determines how quickly you recover lost **Endurance**.  Additionally, Constitution is a factor in your starting **Endurance** score as described below.
#### Endurance
**Endurance** represents your character's inherent ability to avoid bleeding to death after being stabbed.  If your Endurance reaches 0 during a duel, your character perishes.
Your initial endurance is calculated by multiplying **Strength** and **Constitution**
### Non-Combat Statistics
Your character begins play between 16 and 21 years of age.  The remainder of the character's statistics describe who their parents were and what kind of jobs they held, how wealthy your character's family is, whether you are an eldest son or a bastard, and whether your parents are still living.
#### Military Ability (MA)
Military Ability will be tested if your character ever reaches a military rank that puts him in command of men.  It is initially determined by rolling 1d6.
#### Social Class
Ranks are **Commoner**, **Gentleman**, and **Nobleman**.  The Rank your family is determines your starting **Social Level (SL)** as described below.  If your character is of the noble class, their father's rank is listed here as well.
#### Family Position
Family Position describes whether your character is a **First Son**, a **Second Son**, or a **Bastard**.  The Family Position table also determines whether your character's parents are still living.
#### Family Wealth
describes how successful your family is currently.  A rating like **Wealthy** or **Very Wealthy** means more support from your character's family, while a rating of **Impoverished** might mean your character receives no support from home at all.
#### Initial Funds
Initial Funds represent the money your character has saved to travel to Paris with.  This the amount of money they have when they arrive on Turn 1.
#### Allowance
Allowance is age that a character receives from their family on Week 1 of each new month.
#### Inheritance
All characters are created with an Inheritance value.  This is money they would receive if they begin the game an orphan.  If your character is not orphaned, it is irrelevant to your character.
#### Social Level (SL)
Social Level represents your character's relative position on the greasy pole of Parisian society.  Peasants and Merchants are around SL 3, while a powerful Count is approximately SL 11.  Your character's Social Level is initially determined by wealth, their family's rank in society, and whether or not you are first born.  After character creation, your character's social level will increase or decrease independently of their family.
## Weeks, Months, Seasons, and Years
The Game plays out over the course of Months, Seasons, and Years.  Each Game Month (1 week realtime), all players must submit orders for the next month prior to the [[#Game Timelines|deadline]].
### Weeks
Every week your character can take one action from the list (under **Actions**).  **Actions** are submitted for the entire month (four weeks) at a time.
### Months
The basic unit of gameplay.  Orders are submitted a month at a time.
### Seasons
Each season is three months.  The Seasons are primarily relevant for characters who are part of a **Regiment**.
#### Winter
December-February
#### Spring
March-May
#### Summer
June-August
#### Autumn
September-November
### Years
Every four Seasons represents a year.  Some game actions taken by **Ministers** take place at the beginning of the year, and your characters become a year older.
## Actions
Every month your character must choose four actions from the below list to take.  You may choose the same option more than once.  Remember that you are **not under any circumstances** bound by the rules to any promise you make with another player, but you **are** bound to the actions listed in your calendar.
### Social Clubs
Joining a Social Club is a good way to gain Status, and an even better way to lose money.  See the [Tables Document](http://www.engarde.co.uk/EnGarde!Tables.pdf) for a list of the Social Clubs and the requirements to join.  All clubs charge dues that are required every month.  If dues are not paid, you are no longer a member of the club and cannot apply to rejoin it for three months.  You must be a member of the club in order to enter, or you may enter with another player who is a member (see **Toadying** below).
The Social Club grants you a number of Social Points every month just for being a member, you do not have to visit the club to gain this benefit, but you **must** pay your dues.  Being a member of a Social Club allows you to **Gamble** and **Carouse**.  Gambling is optional, Carousing is not.
You may bring your mistress to the club as a guest with you, which fulfills the **Companionship** rule.
#### Gambling
Characters may gamble at Social Clubs or at the **Bawdyhouse**.  The rules of gambling are simple.  A die is thrown for the player and by the *croupier* and the higher die wins, with ties going to the house.  After the house die is thrown, but before the player rolls, the player may opt to *cut*.  That is to give up half their bet and not roll.  Winning at gambling earns the player Status, while losing and cutting cost the player Status.  A character may not make more than 9 throws in a given week.
The procedure for gambling are as follows:
1. The player decides how many throws of the dice he is willing to risk and the amount he is betting on **each throw** (respecting the **House Limit** for the Club you are in.)
2. The player decides on a *cut*, which is the number that he will choose not to roll and instead forfeit half of his bet.
3. Dice are thrown and the higher roller is the winner.
4. Rolls are repeated until all throws are completed.
Status and Crowns are gained and lost from gambling as follows:
1. If the player wins, they win an amount of money equal to their wager and one status point.
2. If the player loses, they forfeit their wager and lose one status point.
3. If the player cuts, they forfeit half of their wager and lose three status points.
4. Additionally, if gambling at a Club, the player sums up their total wager and divides it by the **Gambling Divisor** of the Club (dropping any fraction).  The result is additional status points gained. 
#### Carousing
While at the Club, your character may opt to purchase drinks for himself and any companions.  The cost of Carousing is equal to the character's **Social Level (SL)**
#### Notating a Club Order
If you intend your character to visit the Club as an action, the format is as follows:
> (Club Name) with (Any Guests you have invited). 

If gambling, you must also add:
> X @ Y, cut at Z

Where X is the number of throws you intend to make, Y is the size of the wager, and Z is the cut number.  If a cut number is omitted, it will be assumed that you intend not to cut.
### Toadying
Toadying is the act of accompanying a higher status character to a club that your character normally could not access.  Your character must receive an invitation from the higher status character in order to Toady.  When you choose the toady action, your character gains status points equal to the highest club your character *could* join and the club your character has been invited to.  The toadying character also gains status points equal to 1/2 the difference between the inviting character and the toady's **Social Level (SL)**.
The inviting character also gains 1 status point per guest he brings with him to the club.
The inviting character's player may demand payment of some sort in exchange for his invitation.  Toadies may gamble at the Club during the week that they are performing the Toady action.
#### Notating a Toady Order
If you intend your character to take the Toady action, the format for the order is as follows:
> Toadying with (inviting character).

If gambling (see [[#Gambling|above]], you must also add:
> X @ Y, cut at Z

Where X is the number of throws you intend to make, Y is the size of the wager, and Z is the cut number.  If a cut number is omitted, it will be assumed that you intend not to cut.
### Courting
In order to win a **mistress**, characters must go courting.  Courting is an action.  In order to declare a Courting action, the character must purchase a **Gift**.  A gift costs Crowns equal to 3 * the prospective mistress's social level.  Even with a lavish gift, success is not guaranteed, but for each additional **Gift** purchased, the die roll is modified by 1 in the character's favor.  If the mistress your character is courting has the *Wealthy* trait may not have the die roll modified by additional gifts.  If the prospective mistress is already seeing another character, the die roll suffers an additional -1.
If the Courting roll fails, the character must try again on another week, and purchase another **Gift**.
A character may only have one mistress at a time, but may attempt to court a new mistress while still with a current mistress.  If he fails to court the new mistress, a die roll is made which may result in the current mistress finding out about the characters action.  This is called an *Indiscretion* and causes the current mistress to immediately stop seeing the character.
#### Notating a Courting Order
If you intend your character to take the Courting action, the format for the order is as follows:
> Courting (mistress) with X gifts worth Y

Where X is the number of gifts (minimum of 1) and Y is the total value of the gifts in question.
### The Bawdyhouse
The bawdyhouses are open to all characters seeking the service of such an establishment (all of the services of the [[#Social Clubs]] above).  Much like a social club, you **must** carouse and have the option of [[#Gambling]] and **Companionship** while visiting.  Unlike the Social Club, a character's mistress **cannot** be brought to the Bawdyhouse.
The city has an innumerable number of bawdyhouses.  Unless you specify that your character is intending to frequent the same one as another character, it is assumed that your character ends up in a different tavern.
When visiting the Bawdyhouse, the player must declare how much money they are carrying with them, and cannot gamble or carouse with more than they have on them.  After leaving the Bawdyhouse, a die roll will occur that may result in the character being robbed of any money they are carrying.
#### Notating a Bawdyhouse Order
If you intend for your character to visit the Bawdyhouse, the format is as follows:
>Visiting bawdyhouse.  Carrying X

Where X is the amount of money your character is carrying.
If seeking companionship, add:
> Companionship

If gambling, add:
> X @ Y, cut at Z

Where X is the number of throws you intend to make, Y is the size of the wager, and Z is the cut number.  If a cut number is omitted, it will be assumed that you intend not to cut.
### Practice
Characters may practice to improve their fencing ability.  For every four weeks of practice, the character's Expertise increases by 1.  The weeks spent practicing do not need to be consecutive.  While practicing, the player may choose to subtract five from Expertise and instead increase Strength by 1.  Players must note on the character sheet which weapon is used to practice with, as the gained expertise only applies when fighting with the weapon used during practice.
If your character belongs to a **Regiment**, he may train with the regimental weapon for free.  If not, he must pay Crowns equal to his current Expertise in order to practice.
#### Notating a Practice Order
If you intend for your character to Practice as an action, the format is as follows:
> Practicing with (weapon). X of 4 Weeks

Where X is the number of weeks you have already practiced.
If the weapon is your regimental weapon, add:
> No cost

Otherwise add:
> Paid X

Where X is your current Expertise value.
### Military Service
If your character joins a **Regiment**, they may be obligated to dedicate a certain amount of their time to military service.  If your character is a **Private** they are obligated to give two weeks a month to the **Regiment**, Subalterns must give up one week a month to supervise the Privates.  Soldiers with a higher rank than Subaltern are not required to perform regular duty unless called up to **Campaign**
#### Notating Military Service Orders
If you intend for your character to perform military service as an action, the format is as follows:
> Military Service
### Notating the Calendar
You are responsible for turning in your character's calendar prior to the [[#Game Timelines|deadline]] each real-time week using the agreed-upon method.  Each set of orders covers 4 weeks, or 1 in-game month.  You may take the same action multiple times if desired.  Events like duels are resolved after orders are submitted, but the death of a character may cause their calendar not to be executed.
## End of Month
At the end of the month, bookkeeping is done and character sheets are updated.  Please note the following changes on your character sheet as instructed by the GM:
- If your character has not fulfilled the **Companionship** rule, they lose two Status Points.  If this is the second or further month of failing to fulfill the **Companionship** rule, they lose four points instead.
- If your character has a mistress, gain status points equal to 1 + 1/2 the difference in her social level and his as long as hers is higher.
- If your character's mistress is *Beautiful*, gain one additional status point.
- If your character has any bonus status from being **Mentioned in Despatch**, those points are added now.
- If your character has accrued status points equal to three times their current [[#Social Level (SL)]], their Social Level increases by one.
- If your character has accrued less status points than his current [[#Social Level (SL)]], his Social Level drops by one.
- Regardless of Social Promotion or Demotion, status points are reset to zero.
- Characters must pay a cost of **Support** equal to their [[#Social Level (SL)]] or his Social Level drops by one.
- Characters must pay a cost of **Support** equal to three times their mistress's [[#Social Level (SL)]] unless the mistress is *Wealthy*.  Failure to pay support causes the character's mistress to abandon them.
