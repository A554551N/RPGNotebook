# How to Play En Garde!
## Character
### Combat Statistics
Your character has a number of statistics used in duels.  Here are a summary of what they do.  **Strength**, **Expertise**, and **Constitution** are determined by rolling 3d6.  **Endurance** is calculated based on **Strength** and **Constitution**.
#### Strength
**Strength** represents your character's physical fitness and is primarily used to determine how much damage you deal when you strike during a duel.  It's also a factor in **Endurance** as described below.
#### Expertise
**Expertise** represents your character's skill with a blade.  During a duel, the character with the higher Expertise is required to script ahead less, and can sometimes act more quickly than a character with lower Expertise.
#### Constitution
**Constitution** represents your character's toughness and healing ability.  After a duel, Constitution determines how quickly you recover lost **Endurance**.  Additionally, Constitution is a factor in your starting **Endurance** score as described below.
#### Endurance
**Endurance** represents your character's inherent ability to avoid bleeding to death after being stabbed.  If your Endurance reaches 0 during a duel, your character perishes.
Your initial endurance is calculated by multiplying **Strength** and **Constitution**
### Non-Combat Statistics
Your character begins play between 16 and 21 years of age.  The remainder of the character's statistics describe who their parents were and what kind of jobs they held, how wealthy your character's family is, whether you are an eldest son or a bastard, and whether your parents are still living.
#### Military Ability (MA)
Military Ability will be tested if your character ever reaches a military rank that puts him in command of men.  It is initially determined by rolling 1d6.
#### Social Class
Ranks are **Commoner**, **Gentleman**, and **Nobleman**.  The Rank your family is determines your starting **Social Level (SL)** as described below.  If your character is of the noble class, their father's rank is listed here as well.
#### Family Position
Family Position describes whether your character is a **First Son**, a **Second Son**, or a **Bastard**.  The Family Position table also determines whether your character's parents are still living.
#### Family Wealth
describes how successful your family is currently.  A rating like **Wealthy** or **Very Wealthy** means more support from your character's family, while a rating of **Impoverished** might mean your character receives no support from home at all.
#### Initial Funds
Initial Funds represent the money your character has saved to travel to Paris with.  This the amount of money they have when they arrive on Turn 1.
#### Allowance
Allowance is age that a character receives from their family on Week 1 of each new month.
#### Inheritance
All characters are created with an Inheritance value.  This is money they would receive if they begin the game an orphan.  If your character is not orphaned, it is irrelevant to your character.
#### Social Level (SL)
Social Level represents your character's relative position on the greasy pole of Parisian society.  Peasants and Merchants are around SL 3, while a powerful Count is approximately SL 11.  Your character's Social Level is initially determined by wealth, their family's rank in society, and whether or not you are first born.  After character creation, your character's social level will increase or decrease independently of their family.
