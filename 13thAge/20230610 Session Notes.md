# Rorschach's Story
- [[Rorschach]] is summoned back to the Court of Stars to meet with the [[Elf Queen]]
- After being transported across the sea by the flying ship of [[Menzel Myryfindor]], he is 'captured' by the Elven guardians and taken before the queen.
- She slaps him and dresses him down for his disloyalty in front of the entire court.  This is a front though, once they are alone she tells him that her nephew (the Ambassador from [[Lady Myryfindor]]'s party) has been kidnapped by unknown assailants.  She sends [[Rorschach]] to find him.
	- What he doesn't know yet is that the kidnapping is a ruse set up by the Ambassador himself to throw further suspicion onto the Dark Elves of the Court.
- As he leaves the Court, someone slips a letter into his pocket.  The letter points him to the city of **Glitterhagen** across the Midland Sea.  The whole way there, [[Rorschach]] can't help but feel like he is being sent on a wild goose chase.
	- When he arrives in the city, he heads to an agent of the Star, (a half-elf) named **Jules** who runs a fabric store.
	- The agent is very nervous, and is clearly hiding things from the experienced spy.  Eventually he folds under pressure and reveals that he was approached by someone he *thought* was from the Court ordering him to provide two bags of the jewels from the emergency cache to a dark elf he met at a tavern not far away.  After the exchange was made, **Jules** became suspicious and discovered that no one from the Court had been in Glitterhagen.  This means that he owes the [[Elf Queen]] two hefty pouches of gems.
	- [[Rorschach]] recommends that he request more gems from the Court of Stars, and Rorschach plans to ambush anyone who comes looking for them.

# Seifer's Story

- After a week of planning and study, [[Seifer Drace]] is introduced to his opponent, a master Druid of the Order of the Red called **Emberstrike**.  **Emberstrike** is a hulking hobgoblin, and believes that no ally of the Dragonwood Circle should ever be permitted to join the Circle of Iron Scales, since the Dragonwood Circle doesn't acccept them.
- They fight, [[Terach]] and [[Rorschach]] aid in spirit while Seifer takes on the form of a monstrous scaly griffin creature while Emberstrike becomes a Red Dragon.  The battle is close, but [[Seifer Drace]] prevails and is welcomed into the Circle.
