# Level 6 Adventure
## Characters  
  
**Rorschach.** Drow Rogue, Deadly Assassin of the Elf Queen and Master Thief.  Wears a mask to cover scarring that he got from a personal encounter with the Crusader.
  
**Seifer.** Human Druid, son of the High Druid and The Emperor.  His mother was nearly killed by Terach when the latter froze a root of the great Dragonwood Tree.  Also is currently a weird hybrid owlbear monster due to a run-in with a hag.
  
**Terach.** Half-Elf Chaos Mage.  Shares a soul with the Prince of Shadows and has a frozen arm courtesy of an ancient artefact of the Lich King.  Amnesiac, but has recently regained a single memory of them being kidnapped from their home by the Prince of Shadows.  
  
**Raik.** Half-Elf Ranger.  In deep shit with the Crusader after betraying his forces during the Battle of the Imminent Grove.  He's been AWOL for awhile (imprisoned and tortured in the Crusader's dungeons), but is getting ready to make a fresh appearance.
  
## Strong Start  
  
Across leagues of burnt and shattered earth, air stinking of ash and sulfur, the party reaches the edge of the Hellhole called "Ardent Strife".  She's a big one, nearly 300 feet into the earth below.  flocks of strange black-winged creatures flutter around a much more recent construction of black iron.  The fortress of the Crusader is bedecked with jagged edges and fluttering banners in the breeze.  It's home to a legion of the black lord's soldiers and workers, and contains dungeons and forges.  Somewhere inside is Raik.

As the party makes their way into the pit, they are attacked by the winged beasts.
