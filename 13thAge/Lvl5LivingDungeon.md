# The Devourer of Terror
*A Living Dungeon bursts through the cobbles of Newport, directly into the Rusty Spigot and begins disgorging nightmare monsters of all description.  In order to put a stop to it, the party must enter the ancient ruin and destroy the binding crystal that holds it together.*

**Theme:** Fear

## The Rusty Spigot's Last Ride.
The group meets up again at The Rusty Spigot after enjoying some time away from adventures.  Just as they finish talking about what they did with their time off, the ground begins to shake.  Grask Ironbelly bursts out of the basement yelling "Gnolls!  Gnolls in the dungeon!"  before being clocked in the head.  "Thought you ought to know..." (he passes out.)

### Gnoll Raiders
*The dungeon has emerged in the basement and begun disgorging gnoll raiders to drag folks back to the dungeon (to draw in adventurers of course)*
1x Gnoll Shredder
3x Gnoll Rangers

A group of Gnoll mooks will be dragging civilians out from under tables and inside from the streets without.  The party can make *literally any roll* to free them, but it takes an action.

## Into the Maw
The basement of the Spigot is unrecognizable, the casks and crates that had once filled the space are gone, replaced by a shallow stairwell that leads up to a pair of ancient stone doors which open menacingly as the adventurers approach (kind of like the gates from Jurassic Park, big torches and shit)

Near the back of the 'throat' is an obvious chokepoint that's slick with blood.  Obvious holes in the wall demonstrate the presence of the spike trap.  The rest of the room is filled with statues from different ages set into niches around the room.  Once the party passes the Maw Trap, the dungeon will shift and trap them within.

### Spike Trap
**Trigger:** Pressure plates on the floor in the chokepoint.
**Disarm:** DC20
**Damage:** 4d6

## What Comes Next?
A series of encounters and choices that reveals something about each of the characters.
- Rorschach gets to relive the raid on the Thieves guild again, this time as an active participant who could change the outcome
	- Crusader foes, orcs, bugbears, Vygotsky?
- Seifer gets to deal with the fears of becoming a monster (vs the Owlbear)
- Terach has to steal things silently from a room full of various Terachs (stabby Terach, casty Terach, juggling Terach) what they're stealing are their own memories.  (This is actually the Prince of Shadows' memory, rather than Terach's.)  If they succeed, they get a few memories from their past.
