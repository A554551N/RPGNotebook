## High Weirdness
7 -[[13thAge/Terach|Terach]] can only speak by asking questions

## Session
- Party investigates the remains of the *Zephyr*, finds Elisa's journal
- After examining the evidence of the sahuagin attack on the beach, the party separates.  Rorschach and Terach begin following the tracks by land while Seifer scouts ahead by air.
- Seifer skips ahead to the Craniform, spotting most of the dangers by air.  They spend the whole day investigating
- Rorschach and Terach fight their way passed a giant beetle and brave the home of Captain Blackbeard
- Rorschach pockets about 1500gp worth of gems and a **+2 axe of lightning**.  I warned him that the gems were property of the dragons who financed the expedition due to the pact Terach made with the [[13thAge/The Three|Blue]]'s agent.
- After reuniting, the party rests.  Rorschach spends his Icon point to dream true and see the fate of Captain Brand.  He sees her floating unconscious in **The Meat Locker Area k-2b**
