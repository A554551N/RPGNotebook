## High Weirdness
[[Terach]] has a Spell Parrot following him around that replicates all of the spells cast within its hearing on a random target.

## Session
- Group meets Uder the Fire Giant and questions him about the passage of the other humans
	- Uder tells them that the others passed a couple days ago.  He saw them fight against some other group, he didn't see who won.
	- He warns the group to go around **Vesuvius**, the Duke's pet bulette.
	- Terach offered tentatively to help Uder open the gate home after all of this is resolved.
