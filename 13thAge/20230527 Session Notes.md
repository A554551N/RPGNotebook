## High Weirdness
Everybody's magic items talk all at once.

## Session
- The party enters the King's chamber to find the king of the sahuagin gorging himself on human flesh while listening to [[Vygotsky]] offer the [[Crusader]]'s plan for an alliance between their people.
- Battle breaks out, [[Vygotsky]] retreats to bring allies to the fight through the [[Echo]].  [[Terach]] blasts one of the King's guards out of existence and replaces them with hostile **Souls of the Consumed** made from the scattered life essences of humans who had met their end in this chamber.
- Lysa spent a Crusader relationship to establish that [[Vygotsky]] is here to kill the king, and not the party.
- [[Rorschach]] deals the killing blow on the King.  When he does, Vygotsky whispers to him, "*His* will be done".
- The last of the King's guard surrenders to the party and takes over as King.  He agrees to stop raiding the Craniformw
- The party frees Brand and her crew and returns them to [[New Port]].
- The outro scene of the adventure shows [[Vygotsky]] murdering the replacement king and installing a puppet ruler over the Sahuagin.  Their city is bent to the will of the Crusader, far from the eyes of the other Icons.
