*The Echo is a demiplane attached to the Real.  The only Icon that knows how to access it is the [[Crusader]]*

- The Echo is where Rogues go when they Shadow Walk
- All Crusader-aligned magic users get their power from and use the Echo to spell.
- The Echo can be used as a shortcut between worlds to allow troops and material to move faster than otherwise possible.
- The Echo is a weird, smudged-shadow negative of the real world.  Inside are prophetic hints of things to come.
