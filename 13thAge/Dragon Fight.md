### Scene Rules
**Scene DC:** **Normal** 20 | **Hard** 25 | **Ridiculous** 30
**Being in a Fire:** Beginning your turn in a place that is burning is 5 fire damage.

I'm a little worried that the dragon is going to go down like a chump (if it does, **enrage** him at 0 hp and up the attack damage to 15 per hit and reset HP to 90).  Fight smart, use fire-breath to keep the enemy at bay and don't land if you can avoid it.  Make liberal use of tail whips that knock the enemies away.

As for the actual battlefield, the village is on fire and the dragon should use that to its advantage.  Grabbing foes and tossing them into burning buildings, knocking said buildings over onto the adventurers, crushing AoEs, and of course gouts of dragonfire.  If it can, the dragon should land in burning buildings to force the melee characters (Rorschach and Seifer) to enter the fire.

## Kobold Warren
*The Warrens are accessible by jumping into the well in the center of the Burning Village.  They are a maze of low tunnels (Medium humanoids must move slowly due to the cramped surrounds).  This is the home of the kobolds of Clan Tuk'Ar, bane of adventurers.*

### Scene Rules
- The warrens are a trackless maze and there are *always* more kobolds and more traps.  Escaping the warrens will require tracking or orientation checks against **DC 20**.  These checks take an action in combat.  3 successes will get them out of the warrens and into the **Heart of the Dungeon**
