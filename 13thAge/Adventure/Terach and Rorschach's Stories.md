# Terach
*Terach intends to enter his own mind realm and try to remember his family.  The powerful shadow magics left by the [[Prince of Shadows]] will try to prevent this.*

Terach touches an artifact during the raid on the skyship that knocks him unconscious.  He 'awakens' in a small house in a village near the foot of the very mountains they're flying over now.  It's quiet, and Terach sees a slightly ajar door at the end of the hall.  Opening it reveals the nursery he's been seeing in his dreams.  When he inevitably looks in the crib, the shadow memories waiting there leap out to attack.  As the shadows in the crib become visible, [[Rorschach]] and [[Seifer Drace]] appear in the world too, having been drawn into Terach's dreams as they slept.

Once the combat is completed, I'm going to hand off to lysa to help me reveal more about Terach's backstory.

## Shadowed Memories
This battle takes place in the mindscape, so a DC 25 Intelligence check (or an Icon spend) will let the characters manipulate the battlefield (I'll rule this on the fly but be pretty generous)

### Living Shadow
```13a
monster: Vampire
```

### Shadow Spawn x10
```13a
monster: Spawn of the Master
```

# Rorschach
*Rorschach is on the trail of a missing Star Court noble.  He's checked-in with a Court asset in Glitterhagen and discovered that someone has used him as a pawn to steal jewels.  [[Rorschach]] decides to lay an ambush and hope that the person returns.*

## Rumble in the Linen Shop
*The Ambassador has entreated the Crusader's people to send an assassin to silence the Agent.  The Cambion assassin (bound with an Iron Collar) will kill him using a dark elf's Silver Blade so that the Ambassador can continue to foment discontent against the Dark Elves in the Court.*

The Assassin is here to kill Jules the Linen Trader.  He will need to go through the Warehouse, into the Shop Floor, up to the Second Floor (Stairs) and into Jules Room (Bedroom), then spend an action to stab him.  Rorschach's goal will be to stop the demon from reaching Jules.

**Warehouse > Shop Floor > Stairs > Second Floor > Bedroom > Stab!**

The Assassin will strike at [[Rorschach]] as needed to become **Cloaked**, and then will disengage to continue seeking its target.  The Cambion is visible in **Shadow Walk** regardless of **Cloak**.

If the Assassin is captured, Rorschach can attempt to get more information (DC 25 relevant) from him, but after 3 questions the Iron Collar will compress suddenly, decapitating the creature.

The Cambion is carrying a dagger of obviously dark elven make.  A well-crafted blade like this would normally only be found in the hands of a Point of the Star (in fact, Rorschach probably has one like it).  The heavy Iron Collar he wore bears the stamped mark of the Crusader.

### The Assassin
```13a
monster: Cambion Hellblade
```


I'm willing to play a little loose here to give Rorschach some leeway on how he gets into the next scene.  As a possibility, the Cambion is carrying a stamped ticket for a ship that entered Glitterhagen from Riddleport, 

## Scheme Revealed
*Following a trail of clues, Rorschach finds himself in a dingy warehouse on the edge of Riddleport.  As he enters, a drow strike team enters from the other side.  They have also been investigating the disappearance of the Ambassador, but they think that he planned it himself.  Unaware of Rorschach's being involved by the Queen, they initially believe him to be an asset of the Ambassador's.*

This can go one of two ways, either Rorschach and the Drow Strike Team come to an agreement about how to deal with the Ambassador (in which case we use the demon encounter), or they can't (in which case they fight).

### Drow Fight
> [!warning] Balance
> This is a **big** fight.  I think we need to call these in in smaller groups of 2 Solders and a Darkbolt.  Additionally, I want to give Greg a Rogue experience.  To do this, I'm going to try and give him a chance to get into hiding and then work on taking them out from cover using sneak attack.  Maybe set the guards patrolling for him, keeping the darkbolts with the leader near the middle.

### Crusader Fight
Bro I have no fucking idea.  I might just have use the Drow stats and skin them as demons.  That should work right?
