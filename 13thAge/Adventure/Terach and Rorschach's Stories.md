# Terach
*Terach intends to enter his own mind realm and try to remember his family.  The powerful shadow magics left by the [[Prince of Shadows]] will try to prevent this.*

Terach touches an artifact during the raid on the skyship that knocks him unconscious.  He 'awakens' in a small house in a village near the foot of the very mountains they're flying over now.  It's quiet, and Terach sees a slightly ajar door at the end of the hall.  Opening it reveals the nursery he's been seeing in his dreams.  When he inevitably looks in the crib, the shadow memories waiting there leap out to attack.  As the shadows in the crib become visible, [[Rorschach]] and [[Seifer Drace]] appear in the world too, having been drawn into Terach's dreams as they slept.

Once the combat is completed, I'm going to hand off to lysa to help me reveal more about Terach's backstory.

## Shadowed Memories
This battle takes place in the mindscape, so a DC 25 Intelligence check (or an Icon spend) will let the characters manipulate the battlefield (I'll rule this on the fly but be pretty generous)

### Living Shadow

### Shadow Spawn x10
