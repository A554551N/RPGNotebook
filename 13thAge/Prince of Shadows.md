*The Unparallelled Thief, The One Who Takes, the Grand Trickster*
**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
**Desires:** To claim that which others cannot, To steal that which could destroy the world, to [[13thAge/Terach|unbind his soul]]
**Fears:** That the vessel will realize what they are, that the hoard might one day be plundered, that one day they will not be fast enough
