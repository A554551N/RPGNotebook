# Notes
- Rorschach meets the drow there to kill the Ambassador, attempts to double cross them but fails.  He escapes from them and runs directly into the Ambassador and his goons.  During the following conversation, the Ambassador blows up the warehouse (killing the drow), and knocking out the Ambassador's guards.  Rorschach agrees to help the Ambassador cover it up, and then kills him as soon as he turns his back on Rorschach.

- During the following conversation, an alarm begins going off.  Etheridge announces that the Library has been infiltrated and that he will reward the party for removing the intruder.
