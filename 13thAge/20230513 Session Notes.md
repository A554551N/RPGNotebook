**Keep last sessions Icon rolls**
- The group parlays with the crew of the **Fist of the Deep** (a frigate converted for undersea use).  Terach convinces them not to call for help by 'surrendering' and turning over the obelisk (the obelisk is a fake) that the [[Crusader]] has been seeking.
- They deal with the arena guards by electrocuting them and stuffing them in the sea horse paddock.
- They head down into the prison, release a handful of craniform, a giant, **Petruska** (see note), and an Eye of the Deep
- [[Rorschach]] places a bomb on the access port down to the guard  barracks, which detonates and kills several suahagin.
- The Eye of the Deep quickly deals with the other guards before leaving.
- After the explosion in the guard barracks, the remainder of the fortress's defenses are on alert.
- A fight breaks out in the **Shrine of Dejobas**.  Enzu, the High Priestess, sends the King's guards into the chokepoint.
	- [[Seifer Drace]] enters scout form and begins searching the shrine for the prisoners (Petruska told them that they would be there).  Instead of prisoners, he finds **Gamaa the Brackish** (see note).  They converse and Seifer convinces the Marid to offer a small blessing to the party (a free recovery)
	- Outside, Rorschach is nearly killed by the Kingsguard Sahuagin.  The priest orders his meat to be collected so that it isn't wasted.
	- [[Terach]] fires off a lightning spell that arcs and kills most of the sahuagin.
	- Petruska chooses this moment to betray Terach, stabbing him with a spear.
	- The gang does mop-up work and prevails (but barely).
- Terach uses a healing potion on **Petruska** so that she won't die.
- At the end of the session, a sailor bursts out of the entrance to the King's Apartments.  Terach offers the man his **Ring of Water Breathing** so that he doesn't die.  He warns them that the sahuagin king is preparing to sacrifice the Captain imminently.

> [!info]- Petruska
> **Petruska** is a malenti, a mutated Sahuagin that has the appearance of a Sea Elf.  They find her where she has been locked up in the Slave Pens for offending the Queen of the Sahuagin.  The wicked Petruska sees an opportunity in the heroes to gain status for herself by offering them to the King.

> [!info]- Gamaa the Brackish
> **Gamaa the Brackish** is a marid from the Plane of Water.  She has been sent by her people to ensure that the sahuagin can't actually summon Dajobas (they can't).
