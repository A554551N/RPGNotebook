- The attack on Etheridge's Library continues.  Waves of pirates begin blowing the doors up from the crypt.  [[Rorschach]] and [[Seifer Drace]] defend the hall from oncoming pirates
	- The pirates brought gun-toting Ogres and hordes of undead pirates.
- [[Terach]] finds [[Menzel Myryfindor]] and tells him that he has a plan to force the Lich King to release Menzel.  Then he calls upon the [[Prince of Shadows]] to help him steal the memory of the Lich King's Staff so that he won't ask for Menzel to recover it.
	- The [[Prince of Shadows]] takes them into the Wizard King's mind.  They witness the Paladin's Final Assault on Omen in person.  They join the Paladin's army as he leads them into the fortress.
	- They end up getting ahead of the army and meet the Wizard King.  He recognizes that they don't belong in his memory.
	- They have a brief conversation wherein the King reveals that he is allied with the [[Elf Queen]] of the Age, and that he is aware of the Paladin who is coming to kill him (in fact he needs it).
	- When the Paladin enters and strikes down the Wizard King, he is also wounded by a [[Nail of Hatred]] that the Wizard King had been concealing.
	- The group grabs his staff (thus securing the memory) and get the hell out of dodge.
- They return just in time for [[Menzel Myryfindor]] to fire the first anti-dragon round into the Hall.

## Consequences
- The [[Lich King]] does not remember what happened to his staff after he died at Omen.
- [[Menzel Myryfindor]] has invaded the home of and fired on **Etheridge**, that probably won't end well.
- The party knows how the Crusader became the Crusader.
