- Something powerful seeks [[Stormbringer]] (it sensed the pulse of magic when [[Saoirse]] activated it).  It will attempt to gain the artefact on the way to [[Avalon]].
	- The remains of a pirate, sailing a damned ship (not exactly Devil Jonah, little more Davy Jones).  It seeks the relic for its own purposes and commands the creatures of the deep to get what it wants.
- [[Baronet Bartram Sumner]] has men out looking for [[Egis Loneur]] after his men spotted him leaving Sumner's office during the party.  He believes that Egis is working for whoever prevented Halla from capturing the *Lightning* and foiled his scheme.  This happens to be true, but he doesn't know that Egis works for Saoirse.
