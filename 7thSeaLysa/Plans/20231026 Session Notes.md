# 20231026 Session Notes
**Location:** Avalon
*After freeing her brother from the [[Baronet Bartram Sumner|Baronet]]'s clutches, [[Saoirse]] plans to break into his home and find some blackmail to convince the Baronet to abandon his pursuit of vengeance.*

- [[Saoirse]] uses [[Mr Morton]]'s influence to get Sumner out of the house.
- [[Saoirse]] and [[Egis Loneur]] break in while Sumner is gone and search his office for proof of his evildoing.
- They find an incredibly state of the art, Fae-made safe behind a portrait.  [[Egis Loneur]] cracks it, but not without consequence.  He is struck with a poison needle of unknown provenance
- Inside the safe is documents pertaining to the Baronet's most damning scheme.
- They also steal some paperwork relating to lesser schemes (mostly embezzlement) that [[Baronet Bartram Sumner|Sumner]] is engaged in.
