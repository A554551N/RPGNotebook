Holst is a large man with a bushy, wiry black beard.  He has a very cool and measured way of speaking, leavened with a sardonic sense of humor that rarely comes across as such.

Holst is a **Hexenwerker**, and created the [[Blutsaugr]] that pursued [[Gustav]] in Carleon and Bernoulli.

He was captured as part of [[Gustav]]'s story in [[Isle of Bernoulli|Bernoulli]]
