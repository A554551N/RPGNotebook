## Story
Egis Loneur is a Montaigne swordsman, a former Musketeer of the Guard, and an accomplished huntsman.  He's also a fugitive from Montaigne for crimes he swears he didn't commit.  Instead, he suggests that his ex-wife and her lover were responsible for having him banished from the country.

After meeting [[Saoirse]] in La Buca, he joined the crew and has been a steadfast ally ever since. . .
As long as you don't need him while he's stealing things.
