**Location:** [[Avalon]]
- *Diligent* returns with no crew aboard (thanks to a Fae glamour), the docks are abuzz with rumours of it being a 'ghost ship from the 7th Sea'
- [[Gustav]] is wounded AF, trapped in and out of consciousness.  At one point he awakens and cries out "THEY'RE COMING FOR ME" before passing out again.
- Ship's Doc is named Nicolaj, he is an Ussuran barber/surgeon with the bedside manner of a brick.   All of his prescriptions include some of Mother's Borscht.
- We get a shot of the merchantman *Persephone* (daughter of Demeter) flagged with Eisen markings.  The captain reads orders to open a crate below and then to evacuate the ship for 72 hours.
- Gustav tells the story of how he lost his castle to the Count and Countess Mitternacht to [[Saoirse]]
- That night, a [[Blutsaugr]] attempts to attack Gustav
	- The blutsaugr looks like a drowned sailor.  His neck rotates in all directions easily.  When it screams the jaw unhinges like a Predator revealing lamprey-like jaws beneath.
	- The group tries to kill it to no avail and decides to flee the house for the safety of the nearest church
- The old priest from the Invisible College that Saoirse saved from the Inquisition is also at the church.
	- He identifies the creature for Saoirse and advises her to remain in the safety of the church and daylight until their ship is made ready to leave.
