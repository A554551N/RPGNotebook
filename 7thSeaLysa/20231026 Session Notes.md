# 20231026 Session Notes
**Location:** Avalon
*After freeing her brother from the [[Baronet Bartram Sumner|Baronet]]'s clutches, [[Saoirse]] plans to break into his home and find some blackmail to convince the Baronet to abandon his pursuit of vengeance.*

- [[Saoirse]] uses [[Mr Morton]]'s influence to get Sumner out of the house.
- [[Saoirse]] and [[Egis Loneur]] break in while Sumner is gone and search his office for proof of his evildoing.
- They find an incredibly state of the art, Fae-made safe behind a portrait.  [[Egis Loneur]] cracks it, but not without consequence.  He is struck with a poison needle of unknown provenance
- Inside the safe is documents pertaining to the Baronet's most damning scheme.
- They also steal some paperwork relating to lesser schemes (mostly embezzlement) that [[Baronet Bartram Sumner|Sumner]] is engaged in.
- [[Saoirse]] spends a Wealth Point for a doctor to heal the poison that got Egis.
- [[Saoirse]] hands over documents connecting Sumner to a number of dangerous pirate groups to [[Mr Morton]].  Morton says he'll handle the rest.
- [[Saoirse]] reaches out through the mirror to [[Rafe Gage]], he is going stir-crazy from his stay in Faerie.
	- Rafe located [[Androw Rakhill]]'s hideout on an unmarked island away from the sealanes near [[Avalon]]
	- [[Saoirse]] offers to send him some nice mortal things to take his mind off of imprisonment
	- They don't discuss [[Saoirse]]'s I love you.
- **23 Days Remain** as the crew crosses over into Montaigne to pick up the ship.
- [[Saoirse]] finds that [[Tessera Bernoulli]] is missing from her hotel room.
	- This occurs as part of Tessera's story *The Sisters of Sophia*.  [[Saoirse]] missed the first step of it while in Avalon.
- [[Gustav]] handily convinces the crew to come back from shore leave early.  The ship is made ready to depart from Montaigne in record time.
- **22 Days Remain**
