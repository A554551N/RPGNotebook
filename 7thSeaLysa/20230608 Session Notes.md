**Location:** The Jungles of Ifri

*The crew has protected Gustav from death at the hands of a nightmare monster.  With  a new ally in tow, they depart to attempt to steal the [[Stormbringer]] out from under the nose of [[Rafe Gage]]*

- [[Saoirse]] travels across Stroz Bay into the Numanari Approach to Ifri.  As they approach the **Eye of the Storm** the ship is made to travel through terrible storms.
- During the storm, the lookout spots two other ships pursuing them.
- The ship survives the storm and docks off the coast of Ifri with about 2 hours lead over their pursuers
- Wasting no time, [[Saoirse]] leaves a small rearguard and begins trekking across trackless jungle in the hurricane.
- On the other side of the jungle she sees [[Rafe Gage|Rafe's]] camp and infiltrates it with **Second Story Work**
- She enters [[Rafe Gage|Rafe's]] tent and finds him in the middle of changing clothes, which leaves her flustered.  [[Gustav]] follows her in.
- [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]] appears perfectly at east, as opposed to [[Saoirse]] who is very nervous.
- She recalls hearing that Rafe was sleeping with a Montaigne Captain (Pichard)
- A guard arrives and warns Rafe  about the approaching Caligari, Avalon, and Montaigne soldiers
- He plans a hasty evacuation of the camp and reveals that it's booby trapped with explosives
- The camp is emptied and Rafe blows up the encircling soldiers (including Morta and the Caligari's three Stregha)
- Tessera reveals that the other Fate Witches can track her.  Gustav and Egis are assigned to take her away from the relic so that she can't reveal its position.
- They go deeper into the jungle and Rafe shows her the entry to the temple, a round hole in the ground.  Once they descend via rope it is revealed that they are inside of a massive underground structure
- Rafe and Saoirse pass through the deathtraps and enter the Tower at the Eye
- The Tower has a toggle-able anti-grav field that allows them to easily ascend.
- They fight an action sequence against Morta, who entered the tower via Second Story Work, and an ancient automaton guardian that protects the Eye.  Saoirse easily prevails over them (I rolled hot fucking garbage, thanks Ike.)
- Saoirse activates the crown and now controls global weather.  Rafe can't easily take it from her because it will try to kill anyone who takes it.
