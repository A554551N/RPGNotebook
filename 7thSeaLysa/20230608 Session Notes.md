**Location:** The Jungles of Ifri

*The crew has protected Gustav from death at the hands of a nightmare monster.  With  a new ally in tow, they depart to attempt to steal the [[Stormbringer]] out from under the nose of [[Rafe Gage]]*

- [[Saoirse]] travels across Stroz Bay into the Numanari Approach to Ifri.  As they approach the **Eye of the Storm** the ship is made to travel through terrible storms.
- During the storm, the lookout spots two other ships pursuing them.
- The ship survives the storm and docks off the coast of Ifri with about 2 hours lead over their pursuers
- Wasting no time, [[Saoirse]] leaves a small rearguard and begins trekking across trackless jungle in the hurricane.
- On the other side of the jungle she sees [[Rafe Gage|Rafe's]] camp and infiltrates it with **Second Story Work**
- She enters [[Rafe Gage|Rafe's]] tent and finds him in the middle of changing clothes, which leaves her flustered.  [[Gustav]] follows her in.
- [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]] appears perfectly at east, as opposed to [[Saoirse]] who is very nervous.
- She recalls hearing that Rafe was sleeping with a Montaigne Captain (Pichard)
- A guard arrives and warns Rafe  about the approaching Caligari, Avalon, and Montaigne soldiers
- He plans a hasty evacuation of the camp and reveals that it's booby trapped with explosives
- The camp is emptied and Rafe blows up the encircling soldiers (including Morta and the Caligari's three Stregha)
- Tessera reveals that the other Fate Witches can track her.  Gustav and Egis are assigned to take her away from the relic so that she can't reveal its position.
- They go deeper into the jungle and Rafe shows her the entry to the temple, a round hole in the ground.  Once they descend via rope it is revealed that they are inside of a massive underground structure
