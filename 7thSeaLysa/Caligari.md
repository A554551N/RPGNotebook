The Caligari are one of the 7 **Merchant Princedoms of Vodacce**.  They are rivals of the [[Bernoulli]] Family.

## Interactions with Saoirse
The Caligari family hired [[Morta]] to steal the journals of [[Rafe Gage]] during the [[Isle of Bernoulli]] incident.

[[Saoirse]] stole the personal pleasure barge of the Prince of House Caligari and sold it to his enemies among the Vendel League.  As revenge, he impounded the [[Vengeance]] and had a good portion of the crew hanged as pirates.  When she returned to collect her ship, he had her arrested as well.

After spending over a week in a Caligari prison, she was released on the condition that she provided the information she'd gathered on the location of the [[Stormbringer]] to the House.
