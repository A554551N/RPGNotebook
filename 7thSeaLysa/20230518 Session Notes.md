**Location:** [[Isle of Bernoulli]]
*Saoirse and Giovanni are trapped in the hold of the Persephone with a monster and its maker.*

- [[Giovanni Bernoulli]] is grabbed by the creature and dragged up onto the top deck.
	- Immediately, [[Saoirse]] leaps passed [[Captain Holst]] who cuts her with his poisoned blade.
	- [[Egis Loneur|Egis]] and [[Gustav]] are on their way to find out what happened to [[Saoirse]] when they see the [[Blutsaugr]] appear on the deck of the [[Persephone]].
	- [[Egis Loneur|Egis]] frees [[Giovanni Bernoulli|Giovanni]] with  a well-placed rifle shot and the two leap into action to hold off the creature while [[Saoirse]] searches the captain's quarters for anything of use.
	- In the Captain's quarters, [[Saoirse]] finds a whole Hexenwerk laboratory as well as detailed schematics of how the [[Blutsaugr]] was made.
	- The [[Captain Holst|Captain]] appears in the doorway and offers [[Saoirse]] safety from the monster if she surrenders.  She refuses.
	- The two fight belowdecks, [[Saoirse]] trying to escape while the Hexenwerker does his best to retrieve the stolen drafts.
	- Abovedeck, the heroes realize that loud noises disorient the creature and use that to their advantage to help survive.
