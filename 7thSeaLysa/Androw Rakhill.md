*Androw 'Roaring' Rakhill was an Avalonian Explorer and Pirate during the war with Montaigne.  He perished in a quest to retrieve the [[Stormbringer]] for Avalon.*

# Description
- Low, soft monotone voice with just a *hint* of pirate.
- Tall, seems very large due to his bulky clothes
- His hook-hand is a [[Syrneth]] relic.  It launches from his hand and can hook and drag people with the attached chain.
- "Give me the artifact and I'll leave ye in peace.  Try to keep it from me and I'll leave ye in peaces."
- Brute Squad are **Pirate** type.  They reduce Strength by 1 each round to drag enemy crew members into the sea to drown the way they did.

# Mechanics
## Strength 15
## Monstrous Qualities
### Elemental - Water
This is a creature of raw elemental might, such as a demon whose blood literally boils in her veins or a hungry ghost of winter who can freeze a man solid with a touch. Choose an element, such as fire, ice, lightning, etc. If this Monster is a Villain, when the Monster is exposed to that element or uses that element to attack the Heroes, it rolls 5 additional dice in any Risk to do so.

### Teleporting
Either by ripping a hole in reality in a similar manner as the Porte mages of Montaigne or by simply vanishing from sight to appear somewhere else, this Monster can move through space with the same effort that a man takes a breath. Spend a Danger Point to have the Monster escape or enter a scene, even if it would be otherwise impossible (such as a room with all doors and windows closed, a sealed underground vault, etc.)

## Advantages (9/20 spent)
### Signature Item - Hook Hand
Choose a specific item that is important to you.  Describe it, decide why it is important, and maybe even give it a name. You can always spend a Hero Point to...
- have your Signature Item appear in the next scene if you lose it or it is stolen.
- gain 2 Bonus Dice on a Risk when using your Signature Item.
- attack a foe to deal Wounds equal to the Raises you spend plus your highest Trait when using the Signature Item.
- prevent a number of Wounds equal to the Raises you spend plus your highest Trait when using the Signature item.
You must always describe how your Signature Item helps you, and it must make sense for the item to gain you any bonuses in this way (GM discretion)

### Time Sense
You always know what time it is. You know how long until the next sunrise or sunset, with less than a one minute margin of error.

### Indomitable Will
After another character attempts to intimidate, seduce, or otherwise goad you, spend a Hero Point to automatically resist.

### Staredown
Spend a Hero Point to intimidate a character into backing down from a threat, letting you into somewhere he shouldnâ€™t, or otherwise getting out of your way.

### Married to the Sea - Maelstrom
You have access to a Ship. If you and your allies already have access to a Ship, your Ship gains an
additional Background. See the Sailing chapter for more information.
