**Affiliation:** [[Bernoulli]], [[Avalon]] (banished)

Rafe is [[Saoirse|Saoirse]]'s estranged husband.  He disappeared after the theft of the [[Cypher Disc|Cypher Disc]] from Carleon castle 5 years ago.  [[Saoirse|Saoirse]] tracked him down to Vodacce and discovered him on the [[Isle of Bernoulli]] living as a Baron in the service of the House.

When she demanded to know what happened, Rafe admitted that he was on the run from the Avalonian government after coming into possession of incredibly dangerous stolen property.  Rafe insisted that he went into hiding to protect [[Saoirse]], but it's to be seen whether she believes that.  During their conversation, Rafe provided her with documents confirming that he had been killed at sea so that she could have the divorce she so desired.

In the years since his disappearance, he has been seeking the [[Syrneth]] artifact [[Stormbringer]] for his patrons in the [[Isle of Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] family while watching over his shoulder for Avalonian spies, as well as the mysterious group that provided him with the [[Cypher Disc|Disc]] to begin with.

When we saw him last he was squaring off with an Avalonian Spy ([[Mr Morton|Mr Morton]]) and might be dead.
