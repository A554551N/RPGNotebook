**Location:** Where it takes place

*The Vengeance departs from Ifri with a precious cargo in tow.  While [[Saoirse]] grabs the artifact, [[Egis Loneur|Egis]] and [[Gustav]] face down an angry Vodacce army.*

- Egis leads Gustav and Tessere away from the Vodacce soldiers and back to the Vengeance.
- The storm aura of [[Stormbringer]] continues to surround the vessel on its journey back, making them the eye of a small hurricane.
- They flee from the coast of Ifri on their way back to Avalon.  Throughout the journey, [[Saoirse]] keeps catching glimpses of another ship tailing them within the storm.
- They see other pursuing ships burst into flames as the *Maelstrom* catches up with them.
- That night, the *Maelstrom* pulls alongside and the Captain (Androw 'Roaring' Rakhill) comes aboard and demands the [[Stormbringer]].  When she declines, he informs her crew that we will return at sunset of the following day to claim the artifact.  He would either take it from the smoking wreckage of the ship or the waiting hand of someone on the crew.
