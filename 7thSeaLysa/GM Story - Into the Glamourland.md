# Synopsis
Jacob Cooper made a deal with the Fae to spare his son Stephen's life when it was threatened by plague.  Now the Fae has returned to demand payment: a barrel that can keep a spirit from escaping, prepared to be collected at the end of the week.

**Goal:** Resolve Jacob Cooper's debt to the Fae

# Steps
1. Visit your family
2. Learn a method of trapping a spirit within a barrel
3. Retrieve the necessary wood and sap from the Glamour Wood

# The Dark Wood
## The Guardian of the Dark Wood
**Strength 10 Monster**
The Guardian was Sidhe once, one with the Wood to defend the midlands of Avalon against Montaigne invaders.  The cost was eternity trapped within the Heart.  When the Fae retreated to Bryn Bresaille, the forest went dormant and the Fae slept.  With their return, they are awake again and remember only their ancient mission.  Defend the forest from Man, grow the forest.

### Vines of the Dark Wood
The Guardian has two Strength 5 Vines that attack seperately from the body

### Suffocating
While the Vines are active, spend a Danger Point to grapple a Hero and inflict double Wounds for the Round.

### Fearsome 2
This Monster is terrifying to behold, much less face.  Heroes suffer a 1D penalty fo each rank of Fearsome when they attempt to act directly against the Guardian of the Dark Wood.

## The Woodwalkers
**Strength 5 Monster Squad**
Woodwalkers come in all shapes and sizes.  In truth, anything that has died within the forest emerges eventually as part of the Guardian.  They emerge in small mobs, moved amongst the trees by the branches of the Guardian.

### Unliving
Spend a Danger Point to restore this Squad to full Strength

# Cutting Wood From the Heart
Removing Wood From the Heart is an Action Sequence.  A barrel will require six staves of Heartwood (six Raises) and collecting enough Sap to seal it will require three Raises.

## Consequences
- Getting dragged away by vines (seperated, attacked by Walkers)

## Opportunities
- Inter a dead thing
	- The Guardian spends its next action subsuming the dead, spending 1 raise to do so.
- Plant a foreign tree (2 raises, one to dig the hole, one to plant it.)
	- The Guardian takes joy in the new tree, slowly making it part of itself.  It will spend 3 raises doing so rather than attacking.
