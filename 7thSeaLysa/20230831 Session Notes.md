**Location:** The Forest Beyond Bryn Bressail

*After escaping Gaspard's lackeys, [[Saoirse]] continues on the road to [[Avalon]] empty-handed.  Exhausted, she falls asleep and awakens in Faerie to face the interrogation of [[Mr Morton]]*

- [[Saoirse]] wakes up in a beautiful autumn-tinged forest with paths formed of creeping thyme.
- [[Mr Morton]] is there in his fully Fae nature, indescribably beautiful and dangerous, like a glacier.
	- He reminds [[Saoirse]] of her deal to destroy [[Stormbringer]] in exchange for [[Rafe Gage]]'s freedom.
	- When she tells him that he can't arrest [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]], because she needs his intelligence to find another [[Syrneth]] artifact to tempt [[Androw Rakhill]] with, he readily agrees to this.  Saoirse is understandably suspicious.
- **Dramatic Sequence:** Saoirse uses *Scholarship* to try and puzzle out Morton's game.
	- She thinks through her knowledge of fae lore and realizes that Morton would only have agreed to the deal if he could somehow imprison [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]] while ensuring that [[Saoirse]] could still benefit from his knowledge.
	- She reasons with Morton that if [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]] where imprisoned that he would refuse to help.
	- Morton counters by telling her that he can trap the man's soul in Faerie, allowing her to speak to him at will but keeping his body safely in Avalonian custody.
	- [[Saoirse]] assumes that, like most Faerie Glamour, the magic that unbinds his soul must have a time limit.  [[Mr Morton]] confirms that it does, 28 days to be exact.
	- [[Saoirse]] can't see any way around accepting the deal.  She takes it, and asks Morton to help her access [[Androw Rakhill]]'s effects in hopes of finding more information about the pirate.

- When she emerges from slumber, she finds [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]] being arrested by soldiers who have boarded from a nearby Man of War.
- [[Saoirse]] and [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]] have a moment.  Rafe initially believes he's been betrayed but Saoirse assures him this is part of the plan.  They kiss (shocking everyone) and then Rafe is carted off for Avalonian prison.
- Upon [[Saoirse]]'s return to her home, [[Mr Morton]] delivers a silver hand mirror that allows her to speak to [[Rafe Gage]] where he is in Faerie.
	- When she communicates with him, he doesn't take being trapped well.
	- [[Saoirse]] points out that the alternative is real life federal pound-thee-in-the-ass prison and he relents.
- Rafe shows Saoirse a number of books he was given by Morton detailing the haul of privateers during the Avalon-Montaigne War that Rackhill fought in.
	- They also discover that every 3 hours that passes in the real world is equivalent to approximately 7 days of time in Faerie. (8 3 hour periods in a day means that every day is 56 days, a week is 392 days, and the entire period is 1568 days or 4.3 years)
- [[Saoirse]] goes to sleep.  **27 Days Remain**
- The next morning [[Saoirse]] heads for **Rakhill House**, where the descendants of the pirate live.  It's a bit run-down, but it's obvious the current owners are doing everything they can to keep it up.
	- The door swings open as they arrive and a battle-axe of a woman comes out (Joana).  She's craggy and her hair is greying.  She yells invective at someone in the house.
	- The other resident (Regina) invites the group in and makes them tea.
	- The sitting room has a giant painting of [[Androw Rakhill]] in it.
	- [[Gustav]] lies that they are seeking information about Rakhill as part of research into the Montaigne-Avalon War.  Saoirse agrees.
	- Regina tells Saoirse the abbreviated story of Rakhill earning the land for the house by returning [[Syrneth]] artifacts to the Crown.
