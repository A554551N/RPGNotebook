**Location:** The Forest Beyond Bryn Bressail

*After escaping Gaspard's lackeys, [[Saoirse]] continues on the road to [[Avalon]] empty-handed.  Exhausted, she falls asleep and awakens in Faerie to face the interrogation of [[Mr Morton]]*

- [[Saoirse]] wakes up in a beautiful autumn-tinged forest with paths formed of creeping thyme.
- [[Mr Morton]] is there in his fully Fae nature, indescribably beautiful and dangerous, like a glacier.
	- He reminds [[Saoirse]] of her deal to destroy [[Stormbringer]] in exchange for [[Rafe Gage]]'s freedom.
	- When she tells him that he can't arrest [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]], because she needs his intelligence to find another [[Syrneth]] artifact to tempt [[Androw Rakhill]] with, he readily agrees to this.  Saoirse is understandably suspicious.
- **Dramatic Sequence:** Saoirse uses *Scholarship* to try and puzzle out Morton's game.
	- She thinks through her knowledge of fae lore and realizes that Morton would only have agreed to the deal if he could somehow imprison [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]] while ensuring that [[Saoirse]] could still benefit from his knowledge.
	- She reasons with Morton that if [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]] where imprisoned that he would refuse to help.
	- Morton counters by telling her that he can trap the man's soul in Faerie, allowing her to speak to him at will but keeping his body safely in Avalonian custody.
	- [[Saoirse]] assumes that, like most Faerie Glamour, the magic that unbinds his soul must have a time limit.  [[Mr Morton]] confirms that it does, 28 days to be exact.
	- [[Saoirse]] can't see any way around accepting the deal.  She takes it, and asks Morton to help her access [[Androw Rakhill]]'s effects in hopes of finding more information about the pirate.

- [[Saoirse]] and [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]] have a moment.  Rafe initially believes he's been betrayed but Saoirse assures him this is part of the plan.  They kiss (shocking everyone) and then Rafe is carted off for Avalonian prison.
