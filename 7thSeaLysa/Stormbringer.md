Stormbringer is a [[Syrneth|Syrneth]] artifact pursued by [[Saoirse|Saoirse]] and [[Rafe Gage|Rafe Gage]] that is supposedly hidden in a [[Syrneth|Syrneth]] ruin located on the coast of **Ifri**.  Legends vary about its capabilities, but most revolve around the artifact's ability to control weather.  According to the version of the legend that [[Saoirse|Saoirse]] has access to, the [[Syrneth|Syrneth]] of Ifri were able to hold off an armada of other [[Syrneth|Syrneth]] using the power of the device

The exact location is still being determined, but we know that it requires the special cypher disc that [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]] received anonymously to locate/open the ruin that contains it.
