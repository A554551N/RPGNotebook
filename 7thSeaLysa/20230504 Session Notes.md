*The group was attacked by a Blutsager sent by an enemy of Gustav's.  They've spent the last two weeks holed up in a church and now they're ready to hit the seas again.*

- [[Saoirse]] and the gang take ship to Bernoulli, pirating along the way.

- **Dramatic Sequence - Investigation**
	- Saoirse learns that Giovanni was taken by 5 Crescent Imperials
	- Egis finds a letter that Vincenzo recognizes as having been delivered to Giovanni in the shop.  It is written in Imperial and scented with an exotic perfume
	- They depart and speak to the dockmaster who admits to having allowed someone to dock without being recorded.  The Crescent ship *Nafkha* was onshore  for about two hours.  The captain and crew appeared to be related.  He seemed intent on something the master couldn't see, paid a hefty bribe for the anonymity, and departed.
	- The innkeeper of the inn Saoirse is staying at saw a cloaked figure nearly knock down one of his patrons.  Shortly after, the Imperial in question followed and nearly knocked down.

- The letter Saoirse found identifies the time and place of a sexytime rendezvous, and confirms that Giovanni and Sayida were seeing each other.
- The captain of *Nafkha* is captained by a man named **Al'Tabil**
	- Al'Tabil is a small-time drug smuggler who moves Iskandar drugs into Theah via Bernoulli.
- Gespucce offers Saoirse **5 Wealth** to go and get Giovanni back.
- Upon her agreement, Gespucce gives her a ship and crew, along with Mario the guard and the Fate Witch Tessera to hunt down Al'Tabil
- After being blessed by Tessera, Saoirse fights her way into Al'Talib's stronghold and rescues Giovanni and Sayeda from the smuggler.
