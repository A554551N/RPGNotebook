# 20231109 Session Notes
**Location:** A mysterious island not far from Avalon.
*[[Saoirse]] discovers the location of the late [[Androw Rakhill]]'s pirate hideout.  She takes the [[Vengeance]] out to have a look around...*

- **19 Days Remain**
- [[Saoirse]] finds the location marked on Rafe's map to the hideout, but doesn't see anything.
- While arguing with [[Rafe Gage]] over whose fault it is that the island isn't there, she realizes she can see it reflected in the back of the enchanted handmirror.
- **Risk** Sailing the Invisible Maze
	- ~~You're lost in the maze~~
	- ~~The ship takes damage (5 Wounds)~~
	- Ship takes 3 Hits
	- ~~It takes a long time (18 days remain)~~
- [[Saoirse]] navigates the Invisible Maze with [[Rafe Gage|Rafe's]] help.  While she investigates the [[Syrneth]] structures within, Rafe gives her a briefing on the many threats that protect a ruin like this.  Lightning-Throwers are common, as are Automotons.  "Crushers, Rollers, and Incinerating Machines".  Reversed Gravity smashing them into the ceiling
- He also mentions carved eye *sensors* that help the lightning-throwers target.
- **Risk** Avoiding the Lightning Throwers
	- ~~You aren't killed by the Lightning-Thrower~~
	- You take 1 wound
	- ~~The crew aren't injured.~~
- [[Saoirse]] gets the crew safely inside the structure.  
- The inside of the tower is hollow, with narrow balconies and tall, skinny staircases connect the balconies.
	- The 2nd floor is where Rakhill's crew slept and lived when they were here.  There is a great deal of detritus from their passing.
	- The 3rd floor comprises the [[Syrneth]] sanctum (and [[Androw Rakhill]]'s vault/office.)
- [[Saoirse]] attempts enter the 3rd floor.  Is stopped by a [[Syrneth]] Eye asking for a password.  She guesses '**Maelstrom**', the name of [[Androw Rakhill]]'s ship.  The door opens (and alerts Rakhill.)
- She goes inside, and discovers Rakhill's ship log.  It's been updated as late as yesterday.
