# 20231109 Session Notes
**Location:** A mysterious island not far from Avalon.
*[[Saoirse]] discovers the location of the late [[Androw Rakhill]]'s pirate hideout.  She takes the [[Vengeance]] out to have a look around...*

- **19 Days Remain**
- [[Saoirse]] finds the location marked on Rafe's map to the hideout, but doesn't see anything.
- While arguing with [[Rafe Gage]] over whose fault it is that the island isn't there, she realizes she can see it reflected in the back of the enchanted handmirror.
