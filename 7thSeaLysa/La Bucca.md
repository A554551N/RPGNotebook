**Sourcebooks:** Core, Pirate Nations
A former prison-island located at the very edge of Thean waters, a prison riot delivered the place into the hands of the prisoners it once housed.  Now affiliated with the **Brotherhood of the Coast**, La Bucca is a free settlement.

La Bucca has become a hub of Thean intrigue, a place where ambassadors of the various nations can interact unofficially and backroom deals can be cut.  The Pirate Queen and the [[Alejandro Abellan|Warden]] accept this as it helps to render the free island too valuable to the system to destroy out of hand.
