The **Persephone** is a smaller-sized Eisen Cargo Fluyt that carried the [[Blutsaugr]] into Avalon and Vodacce.  It is captained by [[Captain Holst]] and his two Hexenwerke apprentices with a crew of hired sailors.
The **Persephone** was chartered for this purpose by the monsters who have taken [[Gustav]]'s land.
