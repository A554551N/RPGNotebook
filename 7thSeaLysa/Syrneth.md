The Syrne were an ancient people that predate men on Theah.  What little is known about them comes from arcahaeological excavation of their ruins.  The Syrne weren't human, that much is obvious from their technology and the proportions of their structures.  The other thing that sets the Syrne apart from modern men are their incredible devices.  Syrneth artifacts frequently have incredible powers over the world.  This has made them sought-after by rulers and would-be rulers the world over.
