**Location:** Off the Coast of [[Avalon]]

*The ship is attacked by a relic-hunting ghost pirate and Saoirse is defeated, Stormbringer is gone.  Now they have to explain to [[Mr Morton]] why they don't have his artifact.*

- [[Saoirse]] unleashes the [[Stormbringer]], leaving a tree-shaped scar on [[Androw Rakhill]]'s ghastly cheek.   She then falls Helpless and Rakhill takes the artifact and leaves.
- Saoirse wakes up with the ship closing in on Avalonian waters.
- [[Rafe Gage]] enters the sickbay, furious that Saoirse lied to him about getting rid of the artifact.  They briefly discuss how to handle [[Mr Morton]]
- [[Saoirse]] decides to reroute the [[Vengeance]] to the [[Kingdom of Montaigne]] rather than immediately face her Fae patron.
- Arriving in the city of Miguet, [[Egis Loneur]] quickly decides to head inland to his home village to visit his father's grave.  He reasons that after 10 years, no one will be looking for him
	- [[Saoirse]] decides to accompany him.
	- A two-day ride passed Charouse takes them to Ribeau.  When Egis goes to see his father's grave, a stranger in peasant garb talks with Saoirse.
		- Saoirse's instincts prick that this guy is important.  She recognizes that he is wearing a costume of peasant garb but is obviously of better stock.
	- They head to the inn after, and the man appears there again shortly after.  After he's had his drink, he says "Good night, Olivian".  This surprises Egis, who didn't think anyone would recognize him.
	- The mystery man is a Porte Sorcerer in league with [[Count Gaspard]].  He Marks their horses so he can track them,
- The two immediately decide to flee back to Charouse
	- When they arrive at the inn, the Sorcier uses his power to Walk to Charouse and keep an eye on the pair.
- To find out what's going on, Saoirse seduces one of the mooks keeping an eye on them.
	- The mook takes her to the sorcier, who takes her to [[Count Gaspard]] via the Walkway.
- We end with them meeting and Saoirse offering to help him capture [[Egis Loneur]].
