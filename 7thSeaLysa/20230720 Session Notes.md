**Location:** Off the Coast of [[Avalon]]

*The ship is attacked by a relic-hunting ghost pirate and Saoirse is defeated, Stormbringer is gone.  Now they have to explain to [[Mr Morton]] why they don't have his artifact.*

- [[Saoirse]] unleashes the [[Stormbringer]], leaving a tree-shaped scar on [[Androw Rakhill]]'s ghastly cheek.   She then falls Helpless and Rakhill takes the artifact and leaves.
- Saoirse wakes up with the ship closing in on Avalonian waters.
- [[Rafe Gage]] enters the sickbay, furious that Saoirse lied to him about getting rid of the artifact.  They briefly discuss how to handle [[Mr Morton]]
- [[Saoirse]] decides to reroute the [[Vengeance]] to the [[Kingdom of Montaigne]] rather than immediately face her Fae patron.
