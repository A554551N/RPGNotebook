The Sidhe are ancient magical beings who inhabit the Glamour Isles (and [[Avalon]] specifically).  Under the rule of Queen Elaine, the Sidhe have become empowered to enter the mortal realm again for the first time in an Age.  They come in all shapes and sizes, but they all share a nearly obsessive passion for tricks, games, and bargains.  They famously can't tell outright lies, but that certainly doesn't stop them from misleading people.
