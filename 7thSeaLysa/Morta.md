## Story
Morta is an assassin who, when last we saw her, was affiliated with the [[Caligari]] Family of Vodacce.  She broke into the home of [[Rafe Gage]] seeking his journals so that the [[Caligari]] could steal the legendary [[Stormbringer]] out from under their rivals' noses.

During the initial robbery, she encountered [[Saoirse]] and the two fought.  [[Saoirse]] escaped with the journals but was wounded in the process.

During the ensuing [[Isle of Bernoulli]] incident, Morta and [[Saoirse]] would cross blades once more on the hold of the ship that the assassin had sailed in on.  In this, [[Saoirse]] once again emerged triumphant.

When we saw Morta last, she was bound for [[Caligari]] territory to advise the Prince of the House that she had failed.

Morta appeared again in Ifri, still trying to claim the [[Stormbringer]] for Caligari.  She and [[Saoirse]] fought, with Saoirse prevailing.  Morta swore vengeance and disappeared once again.
