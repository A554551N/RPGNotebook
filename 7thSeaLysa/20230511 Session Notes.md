**Location:** [[Isle of Bernoulli]]

*After rescuing Giovanni from his captors, the group returns to Bernoulli to plan their next move.  Saoirse maneuvers Giovanni into letting him take her sister with her to Ifri*

- [[Giovanni Bernoulli|Giovanni]] shows up early the next morning with breakfast
- it's revealed that Gustav is taking anti-vampire precautions
- Giovanni agress to allowing [[Saoirse]] to take [[Tessera Bernoulli]] aboard her ship to help locate the Stormbringer in Ifri, but only if she promises to return the fate witch to Bernoulli within 3 months.
- Tessera and her servant Ginestra arrive to talk terms with Saoirse
	- Saoirse suggests that she will try to find a way for Tessera to escape the ship during her time with the Vengeance.
	- Tessera warns Saoirse that Gespucci [[Bernoulli]] will have her killed if the witch doesn't return as agreed.
- [[Gustav]] is having trouble sleeping, but is hiding it.
- Saoirse demands a rematch from Giovanni in fencing.  She loses again.
- Gustav and Egis spot the Eisen ship *[[Persephone]]* in harbor and run to tell Saoirse.  She enlists Giovanni's help in proving what's aboard and dealing with it.
- Gustav finds the *Persephone*'s crew at Vincenzo's and gets them talking about their voyage
	- When they arrive in a port, the captain gives them enough money to get hammered and demands they leave the ship and not return until morning.  Most stops only last a single night.  Once they arrived in Carleon, the captain didn't let them back aboard for 3 days.
	- The crewman Gustav talked to seemed to think that the captain was smuggling drugs or something.
- Saoirse and Giovanni investigate the *Persephone* (finding it abandoned) but chicken out before going into the hold.
- They find a place to observe the ship from a distance, and see the [[Blutsaugr]] coming out of the hold.  A moment later, Gustav arrives at the ship and is attacked.
- During the fight, the blutsaugr attempts to carry Gustav away, but fails
- During the fight, Saoirse hears strange flute music coming from nearby that she remembers hearing in her nightmares of the creature.
- Saoirse rushes into the boarding house to confront the mysterious flute player and find [[Captain Holst|The Captain of the Persephone]] sitting in a chalk circle and playing a strange looking panflute.  When the circle is disturbed, he comes to.
- The Captain collects a little of Gustav's blood on his glove and refuses to dispose of it no matter how Saoirse demanded
- They all return to the *Persephone* under the guise of wanting to conduct a routine inspection, and the Captain shows them the hold.  Inside are several dead goats and the crates of earth that the Blutsaugr is carried in.
- Saoirse demands answers, to which the Captain merely laughs and asks "You believe that I have a dangerous monster in the hold.  You saw it leave, and now you walk straight into its lair?"
- As if on cue, Giovanni is suddenly dragged out of sight by the Blutsaugr.
