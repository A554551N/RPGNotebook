# 20231123 Session Notes
**Location:** A Syrneth Vault Beneath an Uncharted Island
*[[Saoirse]] and company have successfully captured [[Androw Rakhill]] and have forced him to reveal the location of his hoard.  He leads them into a vault beneath his hideout in the Syrneth ruins.  When [[Saoirse]] enters, the Automaton Guardians awaken and engage her.*

**Action Sequence - Recovering Stormbringer From the Vault**
- [[Saoirse]], with [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]]'s help from the Looking Glass, dodges and weaves between automatons.  She uses her clothes as impromptu blindfolds to disable some of the automatons.  She rushes the pile to reach Stormbringer.
- Up on the platform, [[Androw Rakhill|Rakhill]] makes his move.  He shoots [[Gustav]] with a hidden gun and then impales him on the Syrneth hook.  He douses himself in water and wets himself with it (so he can teleport).
- [[Gustav]] and [[Egis Loneur|Egis]] gang-up on Rackhill, trying to rip out the Rod of Stasis, knowing it will kill him.
- He escapes their clutches, but not before [[Gustav]] dries him off so that he can't teleport.
- [[Androw Rakhill]] leaps down to pursue [[Saoirse]], in the ensuing fight, she rips out the rod and leaves Rakhill to his belated drowning.
**End Action Sequence
- Using [[Stormbringer]], [[Saoirse]] powers the Rod that was inside Rakhill.  It gives her the ability to control the Syrneth site.  She uses this newfound power to escape the site and return to [[Avalon]].
- She buries the Stormbringer with the [[Guardian of the Dark Wood]] where it can be neutralized.
- [[Mr Morton]] offers to keep [[Rafe Gage]] in Bryn Bressail if [[Saoirse]] would prefer it.  She insists on having him back.  Morton offers inducement up to and including allowing her father to shoe the Queen's court (and become insanely wealthy as a byproduct).  She rejects him.
	- [[Rafe Gage]] is returned with no clothes, a little prank of Morton's.
	- Morton neglected to return Rafe's papers (comprising the manuscript to his latest books).  He definitely destroys them.
