# 20231123 Session Notes
**Location:** A Syrneth Vault Beneath an Uncharted Island
*[[Saoirse]] and company have successfully captured [[Androw Rakhill]] and have forced him to reveal the location of his hoard.  He leads them into a vault beneath his hideout in the Syrneth ruins.  When [[Saoirse]] enters, the Automaton Guardians awaken and engage her.*

**Action Sequence - Recovering Stormbringer From the Vault**
- [[Saoirse]], with [[Rafe Gage|Rafe]]'s help from the Looking Glass, dodges and weaves between automatons.  She uses her clothes as impromptu blindfolds to disable some of the automatons.  She rushes the pile to reach Stormbringer.
- Up on the platform, [[Androw Rakhill|Rakhill]] makes his move.  He shoots [[Gustav]] with a hidden gun and then impales him on the Syrneth hook.  He douses himself in water and wets himself with it (so he can teleport).
- [[Gustav]] and [[Egis Loneur|Egis]] gang-up on Rackhill, trying to rip out the Rod of Stasis, knowing it will kill him.
