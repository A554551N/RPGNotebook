# The Cults of Elemental Evil
***Faction***
*Special Rule: The Cults of Chaos are always battling for supremacy internally.  When an **Aligned Cult** is stepped up or down, another cult must be stepped in the opposite direction.  A d12 cult must always be selected for down-stepping when applicable, and a d4 cult must always be selected for up-stepping.  Both conditions subject to plausibility.*

## Cult of Chaos 4d10

### Aligned Cults
Elemental Fire d8
Elemental Water d4
Elemental Air d6
Elemental Earth d6

### Actions
Assassinate d8
Indoctrinate d8
Summon d10
Influence d8

## SFX
*Spread the Faith* - Step down one of the **Cults**, step down **Cult of Chaos**  Create a faction at **Cult of Chaos** current rating stepped down one size.  The new faction is aligned with whichever cult was stepped down, has a maximum **Action** die size equal to the original size of the Cult die, and can act directly against the heroes.  All subcults have the following SFX:

*Victory is Ours!* - When the cult claims a victory (as defined by the GM), their **Aligned Cult** is stepped up by one.

*Recruit Talent* - Make a Test using Indoctrinate vs another faction.  If successful, step up one of the **Actions** of the cult for the rest of the session as you attract new blood to fill out the ranks.  Step up whichever **Aligned Cult** was used in the Test.  If the Test is failed, step down the **Aligned Cult**.

*Sacrifices* - If two cults have a d12 rating, step them both down twice (to d8)  Either add a new die to **Cult of Chaos** or step up **Cult of Chaos**.  Other cults are not stepped up in exchange.

*Enemy of my Enemy* - Spend a PP to allow two subcults to set aside their enmity and join forces in an Action against the Heroes.
