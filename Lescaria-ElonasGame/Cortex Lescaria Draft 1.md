# Cortex Lescaria
*Utilizing Cortex Prime for the sequel to **Elona's Game***

## Prime Sets
### Attributes
- Thinking of going with the Classic Six for attributes, just to maintain that D&D feel.
- Another set (from *Dragon Brigade*) is Courage, Faith, Guile, Reason, Vigor
### Skills
- Could blend the 5e and Cortex skill list to make something that still feels like D&D (it would allow for 'make a perception check' for example)
- Use of skills would also allow specialization, which improves the 5e skill system with...well, specialization.
- Skills are easy and it makes it easy to identify the kinds of thing your character is good at.
### Distinctions
- My gut is to do **Ancestry**, **Class**, and **Background**.  This might prove troublesome for humans though.
	- I would build specific distinctions as needed to cover the primary types
### Roles
- Roles are an option.  They're simpler than skills, and could still have specializations without too much trouble.
- The defaults would probably be Fighter, Rogue, Mage, Bard(?), and Other
	- Other would be a catch-all, if you have a specific role in mind you could rate it with a die.

## Mods
* Scale
* Bosses & Mobs
* Limited Doom Pools(?)
	* Thinking for time spent in the dungeon or particular dangers, kind of a specific riff on Challenges.  I also could see using the rules for Bosses as the dungeon itself.  The dungeon gets a rating (say 5d6) as well as some distinctions.  As the characters plunder the place, tests against the dungeon can make it permanently less dangerous.
* Catalysts? (For NPCs who aren't bosses)
	* I like the concept of Catalysts, especially if we're using Skills (so I don't have to build out big piles of skills).
* Stress

##### Value Statements
**Devotion:** I'll stand between my friends and anything that would hurt them
**Glory**: 'Warton the Dragonslayer' has a nice ring to it...
**Justice**: The law's never done much for me, I'd rather hand out the justice on my own.
**Liberty**: If I can't be free to do as I please, what's the point?
**Mastery**: Busted gear gets you dead, so I take good care of mine.
**Truth**: Everybody lies, but if you lie to me I punch your face in.

##### Musing about Values
>I took Justice & Liberty for Criminal, Glory & Mastery for Fighter, and Devotion & Glory for If the Sea's...
>
>My thought process here is that Justice is important to Warton (if in a negative sense, it might also be viewed as a desire to 'even scales') and Liberty is the goal of the Criminal.  For the Fighter aspect, I took Glory (obviously, IMO) and Mastery (to represent the discipline and skill he develops during this phase).  I finished with Devotion (no fun being a drunk if you've no one to drink with) and Glory (Warton takes pleasure in drinking his opponents under the table.
>
>For his 3 free increases, I took two increases to Devotion to represent Warton's newfound dedication to Elona, and one increase to Liberty...he still does what he wants.*


*Start with a relationship with all other PCs, additional relationships may be bought during Growth.  If your game has less than 4 total PCs, each player should create relationships relating to their distinctions until they have a minimum of 3.*
#### Relationships
**Elona** d10 | "Elona pulled my neck out of the hangman's noose and I'll never forget it.  Not that I'll ever let her know I'm grateful."
**Canary's Rest** d8 | "Since we killed Cryovain, I'm something of a hero here.  Who could not love a place that gives you free drink?"
**Brynn** d6 | "Despite our long-term marriage, she keeps trying to kill me."

*Total of 5 pts combined for spec & assets, nothing higher than d8.  Starts at d6.  Magic users must have a Magical Specialty defined*
