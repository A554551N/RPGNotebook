**Strong Start:** Tanithil informs the party that they cannot leave without the Crown.

- Party encounters spiderlings while exploring, [[Amelio]] looks into their many eyes and sees an infinite number of possible futures.
	- They pursue the spiders and discover a roundabout on the avenue within which is a great fountain showing the King of Mt Throndor in his prime.  [[Amelio]] searches the statue and finds a small compartment containing a mixture of ancient coins and a sheet of paper perfectly preserved and covered in dwarven runes.

> It's a bank slip that would permit the bearer to withdraw a couple magic items and 1000 gold pieces from a bank in the Marketplace (appears on a 1-5 of 1d20 in Diamond Markets)

- The party discovers a battle site where a dozen dwarves faced off against the monsters.  [[Krim]] finds a strange idol in the shape of an eldritch Thing made out of the same weird stone that the giants worship outside the Mountain.

> The idol will give the person who owns it weird dreams while it is nearby.

- The party finds a bridge rigged to blow and more of the spiderlings, nearby they find the bank referred to above.
- They enter the bank and deal with **The Teller** (reskinned CR9 Clay Golem).  The Teller reads the bank note and recognizes [[Krim]] as **Barborlum Giantmaster** and retrieves his stuff.  His vault contains 1000gp, a +2 Polearm, Cape of the Mountebank, and a Figurine of Wondrous Power (Onyx Fly)
- [[Skamir]] proceeds to attempt to rob the bank by following The Teller into the vault, triggering a failsafe.  The teleportation gateway between the branch and the vault severed.
- The following are the rules of the Bank when a robbery is attempted:
	- The Vault is severed from all of the branches.  There is no oxygen in the Vault
	- The Teller attempts to neutralize the threat and additional Tellers are summoned.
		- Any Teller destroyed during combat self-destruct to prevent their keys from being captured.
	- The police are called (the zone Alarm level goes up by 1), but no police force will ever arrive.
- Eventually [[Krim]] is able to Hypnotic Pattern [[Skamir]] and drag him out of the vault.
