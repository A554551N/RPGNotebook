**Strong Start:** Spiders
- The gang beats up some nightmare spiders
- Afterward they find the corpse of the last King of Sarphil
	- They get some magic items and the base of the Crown, but the jewel has been stolen by the weird mutant dwarves
- The gang decides to rest, and finds the hollowed out shell of a dwarven police station (with a watchtower) in the Citadel District, and marks it for future use.
