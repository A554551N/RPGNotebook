# The Dragonslayers' Secret
## Location
The Dragonslayers' Retreat is located in a narrow crag which leads into a ravine.  The ravine is filled with strange, otherworldly flora and fauna.  At the bottom is the smashed remains of the old keep (basically just the basements and foundation), which has clearly been built over.  Underneath the keep is a large door, until recently sealed with magical runes.  Within the sealed door is the Dragonslayer's Sanctum, a laboratory and escape bunker for the brightest minds of their order.

Inside the Sanctum, the world appears exactly as it did before the keep was lost.  It is patrolled by guards and hums with activity.  In the center chambers (sealed to keep wayward adventurers out of course) the Arcanists protect the Order's finest weapons against the dragons.  Of primary interest to the party, the Arcanists discovered that a specific demon's powerful infernal flames could render even the bones and flesh of a dragon to ash.

## Challenges
- Getting into the Enclave (probably a fight against some kind of weird mutant beast)
- The enclave is on alert right now because "Some dead-eyed crazy woman" blasted her way through the security and into the depths of their home.  She hasn't come out yet (Blodwen has come and gone, actually, but the party doesn't need to know this).
	- The Enclave is primarily populated by Fungal Dwarves (they're dwarves, but growing weird mushrooms all over the place.  Lots of spores.)
	- Security makes this tough, convincing these odd Fey that the party are good takes work.
- The lair itself appears to be trapped in some kind of sepia-toned time loop.  The party aren't recognized by the guards within the bunker, so a plan will be necessary to access the core of the bunker without fighting dozens of enraged dragonslayers.
	- I'm thinking the door takes "key cards," amulets that approved members of the order get.
- In the final chamber, the time loop begins to unwind.  I'm not exactly sure what to do here but I want to give the players a chance to relive this battle and also learn the story of what happened here (the Woman laid it to waste to retreive another old demon that was being used as a glorified garbage disposal).
- When the loop breaks it's clear that the storage tanks of infernal fire have been destroyed, but luckily for the group, they know some demons...
