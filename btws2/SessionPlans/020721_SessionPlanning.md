*In Pursuit of Elowen in the Frozen Wastes*

## Polar Owlbear
CR 9 | PB+4 | AC 14 | HP 150 | AB +9 | Save 16
+5/+1/+3/-4/+1/-2
**Multiattack CB**
**Crushing Paws** +9 / 14 (2d8+5) bludgeoning, DC 16 STR Save or fall prone
**Bite** +9 / 16 (2d10+5) piercing (Advantage if knocked prone by Claws)

### Tactics
The owlbear is being driven to attack by the strange pheremone emitting from the arrow that nearly hit the party.  If **bloodied**, it will flee.

The owlbear prioritizes attacks on bloodied foes, focusing on bringing one down to eat.  While no foe is bloodied, attacks the foe that has dealt them the most damage.

## Elowen's Lair
Elowen's lair is a frozen cave bored into a glacier older than time itself.  Elowen has been stocking and preparing this small cave system with traps and supplies in order to retreat if the cottage was ever compromised.  Unfortunately, said traps can't distinguish between friends and foes.

### Potential Threats
- All sorts of fucked up traps
	- Bear traps in the snow
	- Crushing ice blocks that fall from the ceiling
	- Jagged icecicles that burst from walls or fall from ceiling
- New Dawners trying to reach Elowen
