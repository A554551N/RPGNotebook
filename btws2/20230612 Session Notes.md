**Strong Start:** The party is faced with a great bridge across a bottomless chasm.  It is obviously rigged to blow.
- Group bypasses the bridge with [[Krim]]'s new Ebony Fly
- They move deeper into the Citadel district and come upon three Dwarven Patrols (Stone Golems) fighting a mob of the mutated Derro led by a stranger-looking creature covered in eyeballs.  The Patrol is guarding a downed Bank Centurion carrying a coffer of gold and gems that has cracked open upon hitting the ground.
	- A short and brutal fight shows off [[Skamir]] and [[Amelio]]'s combat prowess.  They make quick work of the mutants but are left with the question of how to deal with two remaining Patrollers safely.
