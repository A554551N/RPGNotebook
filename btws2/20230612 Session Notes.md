**Strong Start:** The party is faced with a great bridge across a bottomless chasm.  It is obviously rigged to blow.
- Group bypasses the bridge with [[Krim]]'s new Ebony Fly
- They move deeper into the Citadel district and come upon three Dwarven Patrols (Stone Golems) fighting a mob of the mutated Derro led by a stranger-looking creature covered in eyeballs.  The Patrol is guarding a downed Bank Centurion carrying a coffer of gold and gems that has cracked open upon hitting the ground.
	- A short and brutal fight shows off [[Skamir]] and [[Amelio]]'s combat prowess.  They make quick work of the mutants but are left with the question of how to deal with two remaining Patrollers safely.
	- [[Deija]] distracts the Patrollers with Thaumaturgy while [[Skamir]] makes off with the chest.  Inside is a ton of money
- The party makes it to Holy Hammer Hall at the Citadel.  The throne room is covered in scintillating, aurora colored webs.  Above the throne is a golden hammer that gleams in the light while every surface is covered with more dull webs.
	- The room is occupied by 3 **Star Spawn Spiderlings** and a **Greater Star Spawn Spiderling**`*` which attack to defend their lair.
	- The Greater Spider descends over the throne while the smaller spiders swarm the party.

> [!info]- Spoiler*
> The Greater Star Spawn Spiderling casts Major Image as combat begins, creating a copy of the creature in the midst of the party.
