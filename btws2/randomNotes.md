# Random BtW Notes
The party is currently hunting the bones of the dragon to keep them out of the hands of the [[New Dawn]].  The bones have proven essentially indestructible to heroes in the past.  They've been reshaped, but cannot be permanently destroyed.

## 12/27 Session
**Sigil of the Heron:** Best Haircut of Amelio's Life (based on an oracle reading from Old Lady Holkin)
**Old Lady Holkin:** Had the dragon tailbone, somewhat of an oracle.  Has a brother in Cathair who she would like to have the bones.  Ashleigh is a distant (but direct) ancestor.
